review/summary: Periwinkle Dartmouth Blazer
review/text: I own the Austin Reed dartmouth blazer in every color in which they make it-- it is a staple of my business wardrobe. Well made, quality fabric, nicely tailored, classic lines, appropriate for a professional woman. (something that can be hard to find at times) It should be noted, however, that the periwinkle and raspberry colors are lovely, but the fabric and buttons are slightly different than the "classic" colors(lighter) and the linings and interfacings are not as substantial as the brown, navy, camel, red and ivory. It's still a good value, particularly as these are colors appropriate to warmer seasons and climates, but I was a bit surprised.

review/summary: Nice collection of Julie Strain images
review/text: This is only for Julie Strain fans. It's a collection of her photos -- about 80 pages worth with a nice section of paintings by Olivia.If you're looking for heavy literary content, this isn't the place to find it -- there's only about 2 pages with text and everything else is photos.Bottom line: if you only want one book, the Six Foot One ... is probably a better choice, however, if you like Julie like I like Julie, you won't go wrong on this one either.

review/summary: First album I've bought since Napster
review/text: We've come a long way since the days of Ninetendo synthesized music! I say without exaggeration that the Chrono Cross Original Soundtrack is probably some of the best instrumental music I've ever heard. Yasunori Mitsuda incorporates so many instruments and musical styles to this collection, it's a real credit to his talent. Guitars, violins, cellos and the piano are just a few of the instruments at play here. Although they differ greatly in musical style, I have to draw an analogy between Mitsuda's music here to the songs of the Grateful Dead: on this album there is a song for every mood.I would recommend this album to those who enjoyed playing the Chrono Trigger/Chrono Cross series, as well as those who are Final Fantasy fans. I stumbled across this music while downloading other video game music off the Internet, and I don't regret spending the money on this album at all. A great deal of care has been given to this music and it really shows in the end product. Anyone who enjoys good music will find it here.Maybe the best tribute to a musician isn't critical acclaim, but emulation by the fans. I've come across sheet music, remixes and covers of Mitsuda's work on this album, all done by fans as tribute and the desire to perform such music for themselves. This album is good stuff. Frankly I hope Mitsuda makes more.

review/summary: Pleasant to the ear, musical masterpiece
review/text: Final fantasy fans may be at first skeptical of Chrono Cross's composition and production under unknown Yasunori Mitsuda, but never fear, Uematsu serves a minor role as Executive Producer! Mistuda knew what music hit home in this Celtic-themed OST. Believe me, I was skeptical as a Final Fantasy fan, until I played the game and couldn't help sitting there listening to the music!The collection is a 3-CD masterpiece. The CD's are in tracks that are appropriately given up in chronological order, and you can picture playing through the game in your mind. What's awesome is the range of new instruments and styles in the sequel to the RPG of all RPGs. MIDI sequences can't show what the original version does in this OST. Rated a 10 by EGM for best music waaaay back in the day, it's not unfounded.Okay, so the insert is in japanese - keep in mind you can't find this thing in the states anymore. DigiCube's downfall makes it hard enough to find this thing, so grab it while you can. You can get translations in a variety of places that no longer have the CDs in stock (there are a few, believe me). If you loved the game, this is a required. If you are a video game music fan, consider it as essential as the FF7 OST and remember the name Yasunori Mitsuda.Things to keep an eye out for - Disc 1, Track 7 displays a theme that you hear throughout the game, and it sounds great to hear it again. All of Disc 3 is pure musical rewards, and Track 7 on it is... well, to avoid spoling too much... it's worth the $32 plus shipping. Oh, and for all the big press Radical Dreamers and Magical Dreamers get, it's worth it even if you haven't played the games all the way through - there aren't any spoilers to ruin the experience. Just pure, amazing rpg music worthy of the title of the game.I ordered this right before going on a Choir Concert Tour Ireland, and the Celtic themes helped me enjoy the experience to the fullest!Oh, if you're considering playing the game, do what I DID NOT DO, and what others hope to do - Play Chrono Trigger First, then Chrono Cross, if you can.

review/summary: Much more than a game Soundtrack.
review/text: This has got to be one of the best video game soundtracks ever. I've actually never really played the game, but somehow discovered the music of it, proving you don't have to like the game to like the soundtrack. I'm sure the game is also great, and maybe someday I'll purchase a PS2 and play it.The way the few different main themes are repeated throughout the discs makes it so much more epic and adventurous. The same notes, played at a different speed and with different instruments can have such different moods, and are certainly not repetitive.Many songs consist of synthesized violins, guitars, Japanese instruments and other stringed instruments, also pianos, interesting percussion, and many other synthesized sounds. The songs are made up of clear, well-produced melodious tones and notes. There are so many different moods on this cd... nostalgic, melancholic, joyful, tense, epic, pensive, spooky, calm, wondrous, ethereal, delightful, catchy... the list goes on. Of course, the music styles range from Celtic sounding, to traditional Japanese, to neoclassical, etc. all blended together nicely with Yasunori Mitsuda's special touch. A lot of the songs really make me think &quot;epic&quot; in one way or another. Many songs are also edgy or stressful like the music for a battle or difficult journey, but sometimes with a childlike tinge, suggesting the fantasy/anime aspect of the game (I'm not saying anime is childish, rather the music sounds that way at times, in a good way) Some songs have soaring melodies that revive the valiant atmosphere of the soundtrack, others have quite gloomy moods, some have simple, charming melodies, some have more spooky or haunting moods, some sound sort of like a big fairground or joyful gathering, and some have more of a feeling of a specific area like a maritime or tropical place - illustrating all the elements of a long, adventurous, tiring journey of many different perils, mysteries, and missions of all sizes.Obviously there are a lot of separate tracks on this soundtrack to encompass every single moment of music in the game (Why would you want to leave anything out?) but even the songs less than a minute are quite good. I'm not going to point out specific tracks because I'd end up listing about one-third of them, nor will I describe many specific tracks; every song is worth listening to, from start to finish. The most talked about song &quot;Radical Dreamers&quot; is a nice song with female vocals in Japanese that follows the main theme of the album, and I can see why most people consider it the best song on here, particularly the last minute or so with the angelic-like hum and amazing, gentle acoustic guitar melodies. The immaculate music box style melody after Radical Dreamers concludes the album with a very memorable sensation.I mentioned in my list of adjectives &quot;nostalgic&quot;: of course it will feel truly nostalgic if you've played the game a few years ago and didn't think about buying the soundtrack until now, reminiscing parts of the game you struggled at and enjoyed while you listen. But if you didn't have the game, it might trigger memories about other games or certain times in childhood... even though this game isn't very old at all. That may sound really weird, but it happens to me a little... I remember having fun with many SNES games since I didn't play through this.This album is sincerely worth the import price, not only is it a triple album with 67 tracks lasting over 3 hours, but is by far the most inspiring game soundtrack I've heard so far and can be enjoyed by people with the most diverse tastes. After listening to this for the first few times, it seems superior to everything else in your music collection.

review/summary: If you want RPG music, this is for you.
review/text: I'm not an expert on Mitsuda's work but I was by no means disappointed by Chrono Cross and the soundtrack it created.Beginning with TIME'S SCAR. Here we have a Celtic dance tune emerging from a quiet beginning whisper. I will admit I love the BRINK OF DEATH although not everyone may agree. The remainder of the first album is like a tour through the music of the first few hours of the game. You'll notice that Arni has two themes for the two worlds, as do many other localities in the game.All along, the tunes are kept simple and in line with the various locations of the game. Rarely do the storyline and music disagree. DREAM OF THE SHORE catches the dark, lonely feeling Serge must have had stranded in the lost world (would have worked better here if it had been autumn in Another World). Other favorites from the first disk are SINGING EMOTIONS, ANOTHER TERMINA which adds a touch of Renaissance style to a Renaissance-style city.Death Volcano is one of the most come-out-of-nowhere themes, as is Child of Time. Beginning from a stir, they grow to match the environment they exist in. The two Guldove themes provide a good example of the contrast between the energetic and vernal Home World and the laid-back, autumnal Another World.The second disc is where it really shines. I won't go through all the examples but will say that Another Marbule and the Magical Dreamers theme are uplifting and excellent. Classical/rock combinations rarely fail.The third disc is haunting, spiritual, romantic, and all. Indeed it is where all the powerful emotions come together in a complex but orderly amalgam. GARDEN OF THE GODS is unforgettable with its choral chant and delicate minor key; the Chronopolis theme shines with futurism and even a touch of scientific socialism. The Fate, Jellyfish, and Orphanage themes stand apart, notably the Jellyfish Sea which really sounds appropriate for an underwater world. It is ambient and environmental.You won't forget the GIRL WHO STOLE THE STARS or TIME OF THE DREAMWATCH, as these are, respectively, the love theme (between Serge and Kid) and the "liberty" overture played in the second intro. After two last super-duper tracks (TOWER OF STARS and DRAGON GOD) we get to the closing music. I found UNSTOLEN JEWEL (Radical Dreamers' LE TRESOR INTERDIT)to be too soft for full effect; the game theme that precedes it is much better. (You have to use the Chrono Cross item to hear it in the game). UNSTOLEN JEWEL reminds me of "My Heart Will Go On" and the main theme from Lord of the Rings in that it is a vocal version of a melody already heard via instruments.Still, by the time this soundtrack is over, you may be either shedding tears or wanting to get the game if you haven't already.

review/summary: An amazing OST!! Perfect in every way!
review/text: I played Chrono Cross a year ago. It was and still is my favorite video game of all time, not because of the thought provoking story, not the memorable cast, what left me crying after a sad scene, or jumping for joy after a stunning victory, was the amazing aural sounds composed by Mitsuda. This man is a genious, combining amazing genres of music into a compilation of tracks that will please any person, even if they don't enjoy instrumental music. Words cannot express some of the emotions the music convey's. Perhaps I love it so much because it is a reminder, a wonderful reminiscent that makes my mind soar whenever I remember where I heard a track in the game, and how the music helped that portion of the game impact my emotions. After listening to this CD, I am certain that the music is the single most important part of any video game, because without it, there is nothing except a group of people talking in silent text, with nothing in the background to make the scene intriguing and/or emotionally impacting. I urge all music fans to buy this CD. For the wonderful music you will have the privelage to listen to, no price can be put. This is truly a priceless experience.

review/text: Attn: Do not purchase from Art_of_Music, copies from this store are bootleg and had terrible sound quality. The soundtrack was released by Miya records, a well known bootlegger, for their poor quality. Seller responded to all my emails until he received the return. I sent several emails to the seller, but never heard from him. I ended up having to go through Amazon's claims to get my refund.Music made me play the game again. I had played Chrono Trigger so many times, but only played Chrono Cross once. The music was so fun to listen to while playing, so I'm going to re-order the soundtrack from Amazon and wait however long it takes for it to ship.I just found out that Chrono Cross is getting released on the Playstation Network. Should be good.

review/text: As a frequent player of RPG's I have listened to many RPG soundtracks, not counting that I've beaten many. But, I must say that in comparison to the Final Fantasy Series (I own 7, 8, 9, and 10 and have played all of them) Chrono Cross easily wins in gameplay and its music. The music seems to perfectly go along with the plot. It is moving and inspiring to keep playing, which is helpful 'cause it took me like 8 hours to figure-out how to get that hydra stuff for Kid and the music continued to reassure me to keep playing.So, you can understand how I feel about this soundtrack, and if you're gonna buy the soundtrack and you don't have the game, which would be awkward, buy the game! Have fun! RPG on!

I played it again after some time, Then i figured it. The music. The game opens with the only fully orchestrated peice, still by the composer Yasunori Mitsuda. Mitsuda synthesizes the rest, nothing of his music is second rate. I couldn't believe a single person sat behind a synthesizer, perhaps with countless samples at his disposal, and created this wonderful accompanyment to the game. When I bought this soundtrack, This very one, it cost me a wopping 50 bucks. I enjoyed the purchase and didn't whine about it because of the quality jump from when listening while playing the game. When you listen to the soundtrack with the game fresh on your mind, you notice all the instuments and sounds that we're left out, or unable to be broadcasted. The very details that made this piece more than a soundtrack. It stands alone as the greatest game soundtrack ever.

review/summary: Yasunori Mitsuda's soothing, classical masterwork.
review/text: While not associated with the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; series, Yasunori Mitsuda has still become a legend for his musical works on Square titles. His legendary works include the soundtracks to &quot;Chrono Trigger&quot; and &quot;Xenogears&quot;, and joining that prestigious list is the &quot;Chrono Cross&quot; soundtrack. Spanning three discs worth of music, the soundtrack to &quot;Chrono Cross&quot; is a soothing, classical masterwork.The first thing that listeners will notice about the &quot;Chrono Cross&quot; soundtrack is that the music is very mild compared to, say, the music of &quot;Xenogears&quot;. That's not saying that there aren't any fast-paced tracks on this soundtrack, but overall the music doesn't demand a powerful emotional response using heavy instrumentation and bass. Instead, the soundtrack uses soothing, gentle melodies to envoke an emotional response, and even during fast-paced songs the feeling of calmness remains. Each song is a work of art, and while some songs are more memorable than others, they all play their part to paint a tapestry of unforgettable sound.One of the soundtrack's greatest accomplishments is the way it sounds. Mitsuda's previous masterpieces always gave the modest impression that, despite the excellence of the melodies, the songs were played using synth-like instruments. The &quot;Chrono Cross&quot; soundtrack rarely, if ever, does that. Although some instrumentation obviously sounds synth-like, the listener can somehow believe that the songs sound orchestrated. Mitsuda's demonstrated his talent for putting quality, life-like music in the &quot;Chrono Cross&quot; game when it was released on the PSX, and that quality has carried over to this marvelous soundtrack.If there is one flaw with the soundtrack, it's that is might be TOO gentle. Some people might be put off by the idea of listening to roughly three hours of gentle music with just a few fast tracks to speed things up. Even the soundtrack's vocal song, &quot;Radical Dreamers&quot;, is slow-paced, and while some people may like it, others may feel the lack of multiple instrumentation (the song uses only an acoustic guitar) actually ruins it. However, if you take the time to listen to the soundtrack, it will grow on you.All in all, the &quot;Chrono Cross&quot; soundtrack is another one of Yasunori Mitsuda's masterpieces. While it may take a couple of tries to get used to the overall gentleness of the music, once it grows on you, you won't be able to stop listening to it. Along with &quot;Xenogears&quot;, &quot;Chrono Cross&quot; is an absolute must-have soundtrack.

review/summary: Amazing!
review/text: This soundtrack is my favorite music of all time, hands down. The intense sadness of "Prisoners of Fate" (which means all the more if you've played the game) and the hope in "A Distant Promise" and "Girl who Stole the Star" have been an important inspiration to me personally throughout my teen years. The higher energy tracks like "Chrono Cross ~ Time's Scar~", "Time of the Dreamwatch", and "Chronomantique" (indefinably remeniscent of Chrono Trigger) are all absolutely superb as well.This soundtrack is amazing music, probably the best of this composer's work (I haven't heard the Xenogears soundtrack, so I can't say for sure), and even if you've never played the game, it would be worth twice the price to buy it.I wish I could give it 6 stars.

review/summary: Some of the best gaming music around.
review/text: Yasunori Mitsuda is one of the best composers for video game music in my opinion. Chrono Cross is a sequal to the popular game, Chrono Trigger. Both soundtracks are composed by this person. Most of the songs on this soundtrack are unlike other soundtracks because these take a form of being more "new age" on a number of the tracks (Time's Scar for example), whereas others more guitar classical (Radical Dreamers, Another Gardopu). The diversity of these songs, and the little overlap (using the same theme over and over again - Although the theme from Magical Dreamers is used in 3-4 tracks).I highly recommend this soundtrack, especially if you played the game or like more classical/newage types of music. Out of all the gaming soundtracks I own (This is probably well over 20 or so) this soundtrack definitely is the top one I enjoy a lot. The themes on most of the songs are great, and there's enough musical diveristy to keep the songs interesting even through multiple times of listening.

review/summary: Mitsuda's Masterpiece
review/text: While Yasunori Mitsuda's score for Chrono Trigger was nicely done and well-composed, it's hard not to notice that it sounds just like what it is: video game music. The game's sequel, on the other hand, while having the same great musical authorship, also sounds much more organic, which is probably why I like the Chrono Cross soundtrack just a little more than its predecessor.Right at the beginning of the first disc "Time's Scar" starts off with a sense of serenity and then grabs your attention by turning into what sounds like a musical stampede. While this is a standout track, many of the pieces just get better from there. The somewhat Carribianesque "Plains of Time" commences with an amazing guitar hook and then proceeds to play the main theme found throughout Chrono Trigger (a very catchy melody which I've always liked). "Dream of the Shore Near Another Ocean" tones things down a bit with its poignant, mournful strings and soft, resplendent keyboard melody playing in the background. Other highlights from disc one include "Aruni Village", "Singing Emotions", "Triumph" (short but sweet), and "Another Galdove."Disc two, being my least favorite of the three, nevertheless has some standout pieces that are not to be missed. "Voyage~Home World" is so amazingly catchy that I simply wore it out after hearing it for the first time. "Chronomantique" is another version of the tune found in "Plains of Time" and "People Imprisoned By Destiny" is arguably the saddest and most moving song in the entire Game Music Genre.Disc three picks things up again and has some of my favorite pieces on the soundtrack. "Garden of God" is just awesome. It has a very New Age-type feel to it. Follow this up with other tracks like "Star-Stealing Girl" and "Dreamwatch Of Time" and you're probably thinking that things just can't get much better. But, just like any good composer, Mitsuda saves the best for last. While many of the reviewers here have highlighted "Radical Dreamers" as a stand-out vocal piece, I'm actually more partial to "Life~Far Away Promise." There's just something about that mourning woodwind that "sings" the chorus (if you will) that just gets to me. Also, as far as video game music goes, I've always preferred instrumental music to vocal tracks. With that being said, both of the songs do an excellent rendition of the main themes found in this soundtrack and I'm sure that most of Mitsuda's fans will enjoy both of them.There's really nothing else I can say that others haven't said already. I would recommend this soundtrack whether or not you're into game music, especially if you're into instrumental music of any kind. Yasunori just plays with so many styles and he does all of them beautifully. Virtually everyone will be able to find something of value in this three disc collection and, as others have mentioned,it is both a masterpiece and a classic.

review/summary: One of the best game music soundtracks - for a game I didn't really play
review/text: Despite the fact that I have only played a small portion of the game, the music I heard (plus the connection to Chrono Trigger which was great as well) led me to purchase the soundtrack, and it remains one of my favorite albums. There is an incredible mix of fun, epic, and emotional songs. Those sad and beautiful tracks I especially like, as there's not too many of those kinds of songs in my other video game soundtracks. I must admit that one of the songs (Life-A Distant Promise) has brought tears to my eyes on many occasions.My one complaint about this soundtrack is that they use guitar fretting effects in many of the songs, which I find distracting. But even if those weren't included I would still consider the collection worth it.

review/text: once again, i'm amazed. I was playing the actual game (not the soundtrack) the other day and i thought in my mind that one of the reasons i always played that game, even though i beat it at least 2 or 3 times is because of the amazing music. so i got the soundtrack. Seriously, its amazing the music he has created with a new wide range of instruments (compared to MIDI only in his still awesome soundtrack, Chrono Trigger). this soundtrack will satisfy your mood no matter what mood you're in. from sad music to happy music to exciting music to calm music this soundtrack has pretty much everything you could want in a game soundtrack. Get this soundtrack if your a fan of Music of any type!!!

review/text: I have many video game soundtracks, as well as anime soundtracks, and I must say that this could top them all. If I could listen to one cd before I die, this might well be it. If you haven't played the game, it really doesn't matter. The compositions should appeal to anyone who loves relaxing yet often upbeat sounds brilliantly put together. I'd definitly recommend it. While you're buying this, I'd also recommend playing the game as well (if you haven't already).

review/summary: Best Video Game Score Ever
review/text: Mitsuda is a musical genius. All the parts he writes seem to fall into place perfectly. I grew up loving music by John Williams and Hans Zimmer and this guy is right up there with them. For some songs his style turns away from the traditonal orchestra and still has the same impact. One of the best parts is only a few songs seem ambient while the others are just amazing. My favorites are, Lost Pieces, Garden of God, On the Banks of a Dream, and possibly the one of the saddest themes I've ever heard is People Seized With Life. First time listeners would probably think this music was from some epic movie when in fact it's the music to an epic game. The Chrono series has two of the best rpg's ever and by far the best composer writing for them.

review/summary: Enchanting Musical Genius
review/text: If there is a music album which almost reaches absoulete perfection this must be it. Every human emotion is mirrored through this unbeleivable three disc set which takes you on a roller coaster ride through the fascinating world of chrono cross.It starts with the soulful enchanting but powerful 'Scars of Time' which seamlesly fuses fast paced mayhem with soul stirring emotions and ends with one of the greatest musical accomplishments of any genre during any time the magnificent &quot;Radical Dreamers Unstolen Jewel&quot;. One word to decribe this song would be enchantment. It transports you to another world a world without sorrow or memory and is everything it should be. The song alone is worth the price of this CD.Amid these two masterpieces are more beautiful gems strewn across this three disc marvel. Magical dreamers is music with true feeling to back it up and another world displays superbly the magic of the acoustic guitar. Even the atmoshperic music is top notch with subtle changes in flavour here and there which entice and charm you.The tunes vary from those depicting bravery and sacrifice like 'Dragon Rider' to those depicting strife and internal grief like 'People imprisoned by destiny'.The wide spectrum of instruments and musical genres is also excellent as it keeps your attention span for the entire three discs.I think this is how music was meant to be. Every note in this album is emotionally charged and there are very few things to forget in this album. If you are looking for good music then chono cross will gve you something which you will never forget and something you will treasure for the rest of your life. I think Yasunori Mitsuda will soon become the premier composer of our time.

review/summary: WOW.
review/text: Yasunori Mitsuda pushed the PlayStation to the limits with one of the most lush soundtracks to ever grace a game. Perfectly keyed to its settings, the music drips with the feeling of tropical islands and exotic locales before dipping into the darker requiems near the end.It's hard to believe this is synthesizer work, as it's some of the clearest and most rich sound to come out of a game. It fits the atmosphere and settings perfectly. It's especially powerful once you've played through the game, as the emotional impact of certain scenes (like the fight against Miguel in the Tower of Geddon) is enhanced beyond words by tracks like &quot;People Imprisoned by Destiny&quot; (disc 2, track 16). Other music - like &quot;Voyage - Home World&quot; (disc 2, track 05) and &quot;Dancing Lizards&quot; (disc 1, track 05) are just perfect for opening the window and feeling good. Mitsuda's skillful mix of dark, operatic, and brooding tunes with bouncy, bright tropicalia makes for an excellent album.This is one of a few game music soundtracks I would fully recommend to everyone, even those who aren't into the genre - or don't play games. It's amazing and should not be missed. And, of course, if you ARE a fan of game music, and don't own this... I'm amazed. Buy it as soon as possible, it is not a regrettable decision.

I'm not gonna name my personal favorites, because...well...that's something you should decide for yourself. So...get this! And decide!

But when I put Chrono Cross into my Playstation for the first time I was blown away by the opening FMV with the score &quot;Time's Scar&quot;. After that I payed real close attention to the music throughout the entire game. I was simply impressed with how the music swept me right into the game. It put me in a different state of mind. Relieved all my stress and let me relax. It scared me when it brought a tear to my eye. Never would I have thought that video game music would do this to me. And no, Im not exaggerating. And I highly reccomend this incredible soundtrack and the rest of Mitsuda's work (Chrono Trigger, Xenogears)to anyone with a taste for beautiful music!

review/summary: Truly a timeless masterpiece...
review/text: For many RPG fans, Chrono Trigger (for the SNES) was considered to be one of the best RPGs ever made. Squaresoft didn't disappoint loyal fans when they unexpectedly came out with Chrono Cross for the PlayStation. Along with Final Fantasy X and Chrono Trigger, I would have to these three games to be the best RPGs of all time.Since I myself am a music buff, I usually rate games and music based on the soundtrack and character development, rather than the actual gameplay and battle system. I won't go into other aspects of the game (see the Chrono Cross PlayStation reviews), but Chrono Cross, lives up to its reputation in all the categories.The music brings in themes from Chrono Trigger (e.g. Track 04 contains music from its predecessor), plus introduces brand new themes with lots of different influences (e.g. the Celtic quality of the introduction theme). Overall, the music is one of the best I've heard for anything (including games and movies), well-deserving a 10 out of 10.

The music was apart of the game, and definatly sets the player into the right frame of mind when playing.I've always found game music to be excellent, but Yasunori Mitsuda stands out in my mind, just as Nobou Uematsu (composer of the Final Fantasy series) does.Each song sounds animated, realistic, and unique. Some of the best songs on the album (in my opinion) are Time's Scar, Another Termina, Lost Child of Time and the Brink of Death. Though I love nearly every song that I remember in the game.This soundtrack is highly recommended!

review/text: I am quite sure any of you actually taking the time to read this have played the game at least once, and heard at least a few of the tracks here. And whether you were aware of it or not, Mitsuda's music contributed greatly to the mood of every single minute of the whole game.Composed of 3 CDs and quite a few songs (I haven't an exact count), all of which are heart-rendering and impressively remarkable, this soundtrack is one I assure you you will not forget. It has everything for every listener -- from fast-paced and energetic (Dancing the Tokage or Termina Home), to slower and more haunting (Dragon God), to purely beautifully composed (Time's Scar), to even some fantastic vocals (Radical Dreamers).This is one of the best videogame soundtracks out there, and surely Mitsuda's best ever. ^_^

review/summary: Masterpiece from a Virtuoso Composer
review/text: Yasunori Mitsuda must be one of the greatest musical virtuosos of our time, and Chrono Cross is his most impressive achievement to date. This Japanese composer - who also wrote the music for Chrono Trigger, Xenogears, and Xenosaga - is a master at using several styles of music to define his unique work: celtic, arabian, classical, neoclassical, and traditional japanese influences are all recognizable and expertly crafted into this work. Rather than limit himself to a narrow selection of instruments and styles, Mitsuda combines these traditional styles and adds his own exciting flavor to the mix. The mixture will capture your ear starting at the beginning.Almost all the tracks will be familiar to those who have played Chrono Cross (an excellent game), and many are reminiscent of the Chrono Trigger soundtrack. These recognizable themes are like mom's apple pie to gamers: they should remind you of long, enjoyable hours and memorable moments from your gameplay experience. Divorced from the video game, the music may not have the nostalgic effects, but it stands alone as a powerhouse of composing talent and a monumental achievement in modern music.The Chrono Cross OST is divided into 3 discs entitled Cause, Unveiling, and Change: each building on the theme of temporal change and disturbance. The best way to listen to this album is from start to finish without interruption; this is the only way you can truly appreciate how the music develops. All the tracks together last slightly longer than three hours, but it will be well worth your investment of time and money. Listening to Mitsuda's work stimulates the imagination and keeps the mind involved, whether it be through exciting, active tracks or ambient, meditative ones.Most of the songs are calm and relaxing, as they are intended to double as background music, but many are sure to get your blood pumping. Some of the best tracks are Time's Grasslands, Dream on a Shore Bordering Another World, Chronomantic, Predicament, Radical Dreamers, and one vocal track, sung in Japanese, that is a beautiful complement to the instrumental work. Certainly do not listen exclusively to these tracks, though, because you would miss the musical experience. After you finish the soundtrack, you will want to start it over and listen again.Mitsuda takes synthetic and game music to a new level. He is the most innovative composer currently working today, and this soundtrack is a collection of some of his most impressive and inspiring work. The Chrono Cross OST is a must have for music and game lovers alike.

review/summary: Chrono Cross: Mitsuda's crowning achievement.
review/text: For those of you who have played the game, you are all too familiar with the various themes throughout the soundtrack. From the moving and dramatic opening song, &quot;Time's Scar,&quot; the upbeat and fun &quot;Dancing the Tokage,&quot; and the eerie vocal track &quot;Radical Dreamers,&quot; this soundtrack satiates those of us with diverse tastes in music.However, for those of you who can't equate love of the soundtrack with love of the game (heaven forbid), then here is some information that you will probably value. Some of the tracks border on celtic themes, while others are of the more traditional classical style of music. There is one vocal song (as mentioned previously) that is absolutely beautiful, even if it is sung in Japanese. Although the music is synthesized, the sounds are so crisp that, for the most part (especially with the opening), you can't tell that the piece is not being performed by real instruments. The synthesized music goes so far as to include &quot;accidentals,&quot; such as the sound of fingers travelling down the guitar strings, which adds to a more realistic sound.I highly reccommend this soundtrack (3CDs) for anyone who enjoys listening to excellent, well written music. Mitsuda's talent is well displayed in this soundtrack (he also wrote the music to Chrono Trigger and Xenogears). If you are leery about jumping into a purchase before sampling some mp3's (don't worry, I'm the same way), then I suggest listening to the three songs I listed in the first paragraph. They are a good representation of the whole, although there are MANY other tracks that are excellent as well.

review/summary: Best game soundtrack in my collection
review/text: Basic info: Music composed arranged and produced by Yasunori Mitsuda. 3-disc set. Disc 1: 69:40 (29 tracks). Disc 2: 59:50 (26 tracks). Disc 3: 53:21 (16 tracks). Most packaging is in Japanese, but you can get the English track list by playing the CD in an internet-connected computer with a CDDB-compatible audio player, like Apple's &quot;iTunes&quot;.I'd heard this was a wonderful soundtrack and bought it at an anime convention before I'd even played the game. If only all my impulse purchases went so well. I knew Mitsuda's style from the &quot;Xenogears&quot; soundtrack, but &quot;Chrono Cross&quot; blew me away.Whereas so many PlayStation game soundtracks are dominated by marches (Brave Fencer Musashiden), or synthesized brass and ominous church-bells (Final Fantasy), Chrono Cross' music offers string quartets, acoustic guitar, bouzouki and a decidedly Celtic feel, with the horns and drums only coming out for the occasional battle theme or Dramatic Moment. Not only does the music fit the exploratory and communicative tasks that it commonly underscores in the game, but it also holds up better for casual listening. This, potentially, is game music for people who don't know or don't like game music. Disc 1 in particular alternates betweens moods of gentleness and uneasy mystery.Disc 3's &quot;Radical Dreamers&quot;, sung by Noriko Mitose, upholds Squaresoft's recent tradition of an end-of-game pop song that is presaged by earlier tracks in the score, and fits in nicely as a closer to the soundtrack, though it probably doesn't stand out enough to show up on internet anime radio stations like Final Fantasy VIII's &quot;Eyes On Me&quot; does.A 3-disc import doesn't come cheap, but if you are at all interested in Chrono Cross and its music, I don't think you'll be disappointed with this soundtrack.

review/summary: Good, and not just for game music
review/text: "I've never played the game, but I've watched it." How many times have you heard that phrase? That was the case for me and Chrono Cross and as a result I had the pleasure of concentrating more on the story and, best of all, the music. Yasunori Mitsuda has a knack for setting the emotional tone of a scene with his music: even on older games such as Chrono Trigger, he demonstrated that video game music can be more than just a repetitive or monotonous theme; rather it can be an entire score. In this case, three CDs worth of a score.Mitsuda and other Japanese composers do something incredibly ambitious with scores like these: writing enough music to fill games that gamers may spend 50 or more hours playing. Yes, even this music can get monotonous at times (RPG gamers will know what I mean by "battle music"), but thankfully, you don't have to listen to the music in that fashion with this soundtrack.My favorite tracks are, of course, the couple that incorporate actual acoustic instruments. The synthesized tracks, however, are still some of the best that I've heard from a video game score. More specifically, the guitar tracks are impressive. The instrumentalists went to the trouble of adding subtle touches like the noise of fingers sliding over steel or nylon strings which is convincing enough at times to make you do an aural double-take.The style is varied, but you can liken it to a bit Celtic, a bit Renaissance, and a bit modern. What really matters is that it sounds good and it's fun to listen to.It's difficult for me to give this or any other game soundtrack five stars when compared to other music selections. I'll just say my 5 star rating is within the context of video game scores - you'll be hard pressed to find a better one. In the context of all music, however, I'd give this a 4 or 4.5, not because of the composer but because of the limitations of the genre. This music needs to be looped and it needs to fit in a small amount of computer memory and as a result will suffer compared to a full orchestral score for an opera or movie. The music still stands on its own and I have no problems recommending this to music lovers in general.

review/summary: Yasunori Mitsuda creates another masterpiece
review/text: Once again, the composer of Chrono Trigger and Xenogears has composed a soundtrack of consistently high quality. I can't wait to see what Yasunori Mitsuda's next project, Tsugunai for the PlayStation 2, will give us.The Chrono Cross Soundtrack, while it has its share of warlike battle anthems to get your heart pounding, seems to focus on calming, Celtic-influenced songs, with lots of guitars and flutes. A nice bonus: since the game takes place in two parallel worlds, most themes have two or more versions, arranged using different tempo and instruments.This 3-CD set includes all the music from Chrono Cross. Although it's all good, highlights include: on disc 1, Scars of Time, both versions of Arni Village, and Memory - Lingering Feelings; on disc 2, Dragon Knight; and on disc 3, Time of the Dreamwatch, Life - The Faraway Promise, and The Jewel Not Stolen (sung by Noriko Mitose).The liner notes include interesting commentary about each and every single track by Mitsuda. However, remember that this is a Japanese soundtrack, and so the liner notes are in Japanese. However, there are translations of them as well as of the track list floating around if, like most Americans, you don't know Japanese.Definitely a good purchase. Well worth the price!

review/summary: Absolutely Awesome!!!
review/text: This soundtrack is one of the best I have ever heard. It contains all of the songs heard in the game. They are mostly played in chronological order. This music is all orchestral and follows a caribbian theme, since the game is based around a group of islands. Most of the songs and the booklet it comes with are all in Japanese. The only things that are in English are a few of the really important song titles. This music is well worth getting even though the price may be a little high. But think about it you are getting 67 songs spread over 3 CD's. Anyway I would highly suggest this music to any Chrono Cross Game fanatic, or if you enjoy orchestral music.Hope this review helps.

review/summary: A soundtrack you'll never forget
review/text: With everything having been said, there's nothing else for me to say except that the music of Chrono Cross has stood up well over these years and still gives me something new everytime I listen.I love this soundtrack mainly for its most heartfelt pieces; the quiet, simmering compositions that tie everything together in between its most powerful and majestic moments."The Scars of Time" is still one of the best, most original theme pieces ever, and the only one on the soundtrack (if I remember right) which Mitsuda created with acoustic, not synthesized, music. Another piece which stands out is "The Bend of Time" (a.k.a. "Ravine - Cleft of Dimension"), which is played in the game at the island where you may return to battle any of the game's creatures over again. I, however, lacking the soundtrack CD at the time, merely went there to listen to the music and let it loop in the background while I went about my business.Some time later I ordered the CD (unheard of on Amazon at the time), and six years on, "The Bend of Time" is still one of the best pieces to put on for a quiet, sunny late afternoon. When my daughter was born, "The Bend of Time," "Another Arni," "Another Guldove," and "Home Arni" made her lullaby playlist, and these are still some of her favorite pieces.What Yasunori Mitsuda has achieved here is an amazing, all-embracing sweep of the entire spectrum of human emotion. It's upbeat, victorious, adventurous, tragic, dramatic, gentle, nostalgic, hostile -- this is music that, if you let it, will touch your life in ways beyond the TV and the PlayStation controller.

review/summary: Beautiful...
review/text: This is easily the best video game soundtrack of the past several years, mixing a wonderful blend of soothing melodies and heart-pounding battle songs. Many of the reviews I've read on the internet like to list a few tracks that 'stand out' on this 3-disc set, but personally I think you have to listen to it all. When listening to this OST by itself, you really can't skip over any one song, espically if you've played the game all the way through at least once.Moving, spiritual music that really goes above and beyond the call of the genre. Any fan of real music should have this in their collection, it is beautiful beyond reproach. Yasunori Mitsuda is a truely brilliant composer.The liner notes that come with the set are in japanese, but a translation can be found at GameFaqs.com in the Chrono Cross section. All in all, this album is WELL worth the import price, and can be enjoyed by people of any age and musical taste.

review/summary: Really Enjoyed It
review/text: I don't care much for Dr. Seuss but after reading Philip Nel's book I changed my mind--that's a good testimonial to the power of Rel's writing and thinking. Rel plays Dr. Seuss the ultimate compliment of treating him as a serious poet as well as one of the 20th century's most interesting visual artists, and after reading his book I decided that a trip to the Mandeville Collections of the library at University of California in San Diego was in order, so I could visit some of the incredible Seuss/Geisel holdings they have there.There's almost too much to take in, for, like William Butler Yeats, Seuss led a career that constantly shifted and metamoprhized itself to meet new historical and political cirsumstances, so he seems to have been both a leftist and a conservative at different junctures of his career, both in politics and in art. As Nel shows us, he was once a cartoonist for the fabled PM magazine and, like Andy Warhol, he served his time slaving in the ad business too. All was in the service of amusing and broadening the minds of US children. Nel doesn't hesitate to administer a sound spanking to the Seuss industry that, since his death, has seen fit to license all kinds of awful products including the recent CAT IN THE HAT film with Mike Myers. Oh, what a cat-astrophe!The book is great and I can especially recommend the work of the picture editor who has given us a bounty of good illustrations.

review/summary: Essential for every personal and Public Library
review/text: If people become the books they read and if "the child is father to the man," then Dr. Seuss (Theodor Seuss Geisel) is the most influential author, poet, and artist of modern times. For me, a daddy to a large family who learned to read with Dr. Seuss and who has memorized too many of the books via repeated readings to young children, Prof. Nel's brilliant 'American Icon' is a long awaited treat. At last a serious treatment of this remarkable genius that is both an engaging read and filled with remarkable insights! I especially enjoyed (and learned more than I care to admit from) Prof. Nel's discussions of the Disneyfication of Seuss - which Nel links to failings in American copyright law, "the other sides of Dr. Seuss" - all of which sides were new to me, and the political genesis of his secular morality in the WWII cartoon work he did at PM magazine. The chapters on Geisel's poetry and artwork and the link Nel makes between Seuss and the historical avant guarde alone make this book a "must buy" for parents and serious readers, not to mention public libraries. Readers of Nel's other books will find the same engaging writing style that makes the book a fun read while imparting a mountain of information and important ideas. This is simply the best and most comprehensive book yet written on the work of Seuss Geisel and what will certainly be the standard for many years to come. Thank you, Prof. Nel, wherever you are, from a reader who grew up with the good doctor and who is growing up with him again years later. Your book, written from your encyclopeadic knowledge of children's literature and the media of this genre - from scanning verse to cubist painting! - explains the power, limits, and popularity of the Seuss phenomenon.

review/summary: Phlip Nel gives silly Seuss a serious treatment
review/text: Theodore Seuss Geisel (1904-1991), aka &quot;Dr. Seuss,&quot; was one of the most influential writers and artists of the 20th century.In 1959, Rudolf Flesch wrote, &quot;A hundred years from now, children and their parents will still eagerly read the books of a fellow called Ted Geisel, popularly known as Dr. Seuss.&quot;Flesch was too conservative in his prediction. A century, and more, from today, Dr. Seuss will still be read when many authors on today's bestseller lists will be forgotten.Published on the centenary of Geisel's birth, Dr. Seuss: American Icon analyzes six key aspects of Seuss's career: poetry, politics, art, biography, marketing, and influence.In six insightful chapters, Philip Nel, Assistant Professor of English at Kansas State University, discusses &quot;U.S. Laureate of Nonsense,&quot; &quot;Dr. Seuss vs. Adolf Hitler,&quot; &quot;The Doc in the Smock,&quot; &quot;The 5,000 Fingers of Dr. S.,&quot; &quot;The Disneyfication of Dr. Seuss,&quot; and &quot;The Cat in the Hat for President.&quot;Nel gives short shrift to Geisel's childhood and family background--and, indeed, to biography in general--preferring to focus on Seuss's writing and art, from his first book, And to Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Street (1937) to his last book, Oh, the Places You'll Go! (1990).Dr. Seuss's breakthrough year was 1957, when he published the two books with which he is most often identified: The Cat in the Hat and How the Grinch Stole Christmas!Other classic works in the Seussian canon are: Horton Hears a Who! (&quot;A person's a person, no matter how small&quot;), Yertle the Turtle (modeled on the rise of Adolf Hitler), Green Eggs and Ham (Seuss's bestselling book), The Sneeches (a criticism of anti-Semitism), The Lorax (a protest against corporate abuse of the environment), and The Butter Battle Book (a critique of Reagan's enthusiasm for the nuclear arms trace).His favorite work, among the books he authored, was The Cat in the Hat, for it, more than any other, taught children to read.While many of his books have a clear and powerful moral, Seuss had a horror of heavy-handed preaching. He sought to teach and ignite the imagination, but was a lifelong opponent of smug, self-righteous bourgeois moralism.&quot;Seuss was a contrarian,&quot; writes Nel, &quot;who enjoyed challenging people to reconsider their assumptions. [He had a] rebellious imagination and a dispositional distaste for rules and regulations.&quot; His work was a &quot;rational insanity&quot; that exhibited &quot;joyous anarchy&quot; and a &quot;lifelong thrill in misbehaving.&quot;A better subtitle for Nel's work would have been American Icon and Iconoclast.Nel tells of Seuss's early years as an advertising artist and as a agitprop cartoonist. The book, however, is not a biography; it is a serious study in the genres of literary and art criticism.For readers who want more biographical information, Nel recommends Dr. Seuss and Mr. Geisel, by Judith Morgan and Neil Morgan (1995), which he describes as &quot;the definitive biography and the single best secondary source on Seuss. Any discussion of Seuss's life and work must begin with this book.&quot;Dr. Seuss: American Icon includes 103 pages of notes, index, and the most comprehensive annotated Seuss bibliography ever assembled. One learns a lot from this book; the author's lucid style makes it not only an enlightening work but a fun read.Philip Nel is the author of J. K. Rowling's Harry Potter Novels: A Reader's Guide (2001) and The Avant-Garde and American Postmodernity (2002).Roy E. Perry of Nolensville, Tennessee, is an advertising copywriter at a Nashville publishing house.

review/summary: Good academic overview
review/text: Philip Nel - Dr. Seuss: American IconThis is basically an academic overview of Seuss poetry, art, cartoons, and the problems with the commercialization of the Seuss name and works after his death. It is not, to any real extent, a biography. Those seeking such should move on.As an academic book it leans on the dry side. It assumes the reader has a fairly good knowledge of Children's Literature and 20th Century cartoons (not the animated kind). Not a book to begin your Dr. Seuss experience with. But if you have read them to your children and are interested about the writing style (there is a good chapter about his poetry) or his art style (not as good a chapter, but still interesting).What interested me the most was the deconstruction of the recent rush to "cash in" on Seuss by Hollywood and advertisers. I think that Nel wants to come down against it, but based on Seuss' background (he started out drawing Flit ads) and the projects he approved during his lifetime; it is a tough argument to make. In the end though Nel does point out that maybe the movies and tie- ins did not have to be so... crass?The book is well researched; lots of neat tidbits are to be gleamed. Early cartoons by Seuss for PM magazine were occasionally (by today's standards) shockingly racist. It makes him a little more human and puts his latter works like the Lorax in a new light.Those in Education may enjoy this background. Fans of Seuss will enjoy the exhaustive bibliography of Seuss's many, many works. Also good list of other works about the man.

review/summary: One of America's greatest creative talents
review/text: "Dr. Seuss: American Icon" by Philip Nel is a thoughtful deconstruction of the life and work of Theodore Geisel (aka Dr. Seuss). In this thoughtful book, Mr. Nel deepens our appreciation for Seuss as a distinctively American poet, artist and educator. The author demonstrates Seuss' wide ranging influence and argues for his rightful place among the most important cultural figures of the 20th century.An English professor at Kansas State University, Mr. Nel uses his historic knowledge to discuss how Seuss' text belongs to a tradition of great nonsense writers. Mr. Nel states that Seuss' carefully-constructed absurdist tales encourage children to challenge the status quo by gently skewering the grown-up world; elsewhere, he uses charts to show how Seuss effectively used meter and rhyme to complement his intentionally ridiculous plots and create masterful stories that have stood up well to the test of time.Mr. Nel recounts Seuss' early career as advertising illustrator and political cartoonist to help us better understand the influences that shaped his classic children's work. As an artist, Mr. Nel suggests that the term "energetic cartoon surrealism" appropriately describes Seuss' creative synthesis of cubism, art nouveau, surrealism and other styles. While Seuss' influence can be detected in modern rap music, children's books, political cartoons and more, Mr. Nel contends that Seuss would not have been happy about the manner in which his works have been posthumously marketed, opining that the "Disneyification" or simplification of Seuss' stories for marketable purposes "threatens to make 'Seuss' synomynous with the ambiguous power of global capitalism". Such commercialism would appear to collide with Seuss' desire to develop critical thinking among young people and to help us all imagine a better world.I highly recommend this book for everyone interested in gaining greater insight and perspective into one of America's greatest creative talents.

review/text: When I recieved this book as a gift for Christmas my first impression went along these line: "Oh great some professor who probably wrote alot of mumbo-jumbo that I don't want to know about Dr. Suess and I know it won't be an enjoyable read."Thanks goodness I read it nonetheless.To my pleasure, Nel hardly writes in the airy academia style with which I expected him to. In fact, he's writes so far from it, with a smart and precise style, I am tempted to revise how I feel about professor-writers. However, in accordance with his academia roots, Nel has a 100 page annotated bibliogarphy that goes along with his work, a nice shrine to prove his homework was well done.As far the actual book goes it is an excellent piece work. "Dr. Seuss: American Icon" looks at the man behind Dr. Suess not as a straight-forward biography, but rather it focuses on different areas of Dr. Suess (i.e. poet, poetry of, artist, artistic style, adult, activist, etc.) and interjects those discussions with biogrphical anecdotes. A very effective attention keeping method.If you're interested in learning more about the work and the man behind the work of Dr. Suess, this is the book that speaks to both and even more. Highly recommended!

review/summary: And to think that I read it on the tram!
review/text: Trams (or any public transport) are not usually the best place to read and absorb scholarly texts. But this one has accompanied me on my daily commute, and I have been absorbed in it. It is well written and comprehensive, and tells the tale of a modern author, with plenty of "Fancy that" and "Well, well" moments. Highly recommended for stationary reading, too.

review/summary: Fascinating account of a genius at work
review/text: As far as I am aware, this is the first book-length study of the work of Dr. Seuss, and Philip Nel has done an excellent job. If the word 'study' makes you nervous, rest assured: this is not a jargon-filled, pretentious analysis. It is, instead, a nicely written work that views Seuss from several different angles: as a poet, a visual artist, a cartoonist, and so on. Nel writes intelligently on how Seuss fits into the canon of nonsense poets, and provides good background on the roots of Seuss's visual style. Some of the WW2/political cartoon material I had read about before, but Nel covers it thoroughly. The most fascinating chapter to me deals with the marketing of Seuss, particularly since his death. Nel holds forth strongly on the abominable 'Grinch' movie (and I trust he feels the same way about the 'Cat in the Hat' film too), and gets into a very interesting discussion of the possible motivations behind the ever-expanding empire of Dr. Seuss Enterprises. (And no, I don't believe it is purely about the profits!)Two small quibbles prevent me from awarding five stars. Firstly, I would have liked the book to be a little longer. The in-depth bibliography is interesting in itself and will be a goldmine to future researchers, but I'm sure Nel could have found a few more things to say - perhaps about Seuss's gender politics. Secondly, the dust jacket on my copy was a little loose.

review/summary: Outstanding Resource for Small Church Pastors
review/text: I just finished the book, &quot;Wonderful Worship in Smaller Churches,&quot; by David Ray, an outstanding resource for small church pastors, as is his other book, &quot;The Big Small Church Book.&quot; I will be rereading both regularly and referring to them often. I may have to reorder the &quot;Big Small Church Book&quot; as my copy is nearly worn out. If I had only two choices for resources for pastors of small churches, it would be these two.I hope the author considers focusing on Christian Education in another book. There is a section in the &quot;Big Small Church Book&quot; on Christian Education, but concentrating on one of the most important church functions individually makes a huge difference, as is proven by this new book. I tell all my colleagues that Rev. Ray's books are worth every dollar and more.

review/text: Many small churches feel like they can not have great worship because they lack the resources that larger churches take for granted.Ray's list of "thou shalts" is worth the price of the book.The description of various "personalities" in the small church is both humorous, and so true.This book gives encouragement as well as practical advice.

review/summary: Not Just for Pastors!
review/text: I just finished reading this amazing book and came away with an entirely different perspective on our smaller congregation. As a ministry leader it is easy to become depressed over what can not be accomplished, and how overworked everyone is in a small church...but we often fail to see all that IS being accomplished and how extraordinary our smaller congregations are.There are many pluses outlined in this book about what works about being smaller, and in this day of mega churches the reminder is a good one. There are some very good tips about altering worship for smaller congregations and valuing it's unique size and working with it well.For the thousands of us who find ourselves in churches with membership of 100 or less, for those who are discouraged when worship attendence is 30 or 40 during the summer, this book is such an uplifting perspective you can't help but be energized!Unlike many tomes of this nature, this is an easy read and the layperson can gobble it up and immediately put it to use. David Ray's writing style is accessible and doesn't make assumptions about the knowledge of the reader, offering explanations where needed that were very helpful.Pick it up even if you are not a pastor, you will gain something from it, I guarantee it!

review/summary: Small church pastor? This is the book on worship
review/text: I hadn't been a small church pastor very long before I began to hear about David R. Ray. If you do any reading in this area, you'll start to see other authors refer to him and a handful of others, especially Anthony Pappas and Carl Dudley (who are also excellent). But Ray is different. Reading his work, I felt as if he had actually visited MY home church. He describes some of the personalities in a church family, and I could supply their names. He lists some of the "Thou Shalts" of a strong worship service, and I heard echoes of my most recent deacons' meeting. He not only gets small church culture, he celebrates it, and he is eager to help small churches learn to get and to celebrate themselves. If you are part of a church where low-morale often coexists with feisty pride, this is a resource that will help. It offers some ways of identifying what church families with 50 or fewer need and hope for from their churches, and how to offer it in ways that are inclusive, warm, fun and authentic. Hallelujah!

review/summary: One of My Favorites Naxos Sor Discs
review/text: This is the 9th CD I've purchased in the Naxos 10 CD "complete" solo guitar works of Fernando Sor. I'm surprised that no one else has reviewed it, because it's easily one of the best in the series for pure listening pleasure. Op. 10 and 12, both extended works ("Fantasies"), are quite enjoyable, but Op. 11--which includes a series of 12 wonderful Minuets-- truly seems a masterpiece and is probably one of Sor's greatest works. Listening to these short pieces, one can really appreciate Sor's influence on Agustin Barrios (considered by many to be the greatest classical guitar composer of all time). John Holmquist, one of America's premier guitarists, performs these works skillfully and expressively, with a delightful, singing quality. Highly recommended.

review/summary: not good
review/text: I bought this book because I read some glowing praise on an online library site. Unfortunately, I was deeply disappointed by page three. I always buy books in the hope and expectation of having an enjoyable read, not to criticise. However, this book is in urgent need of good editing -- though quite possibly editing alone wouldn't save it. Examples: a bed squeaks slightly and sharply in the same sentence; a nightgown hangs freely over her girlish figure and olive colored complexion; coffee aromas huddle; rumbling clouds huddle (as well as the coffee?); she prepared to sip her coffee beneath the wrath of God... cuddled within the arms of a strong breeze; (the wrath of God is a breeze?); the Columbian (stet) coffee aroma danced beneath her sculpted tan nose; the coffee bean fragrance tangoed within her body; she placed her thick pink lips against the warm cup;... and so on, all by page three. It is quite possible that the storyline is deeply moving. I'll never know because I can't bring myself to continue. Sorry.

review/summary: Here is my opinion
review/text: I have to admit, I am not one to write reviews on book. I do however like to read them. Some of the reviews are great, some are cruel, but the reviews on this book were absolutlely hysterical. I read this book and after watching the war of the words I couldn't help, but to jump in. I am on the good side of the book. I loved how it kept my intersted. On the bad side I have to say, there was a typo featured on the back cover and the secret to liking this book is making it through the first chapter. I have to admit I was a little curious when I read some of the reviews. They were so mean and false that it spiked my curiosity. I then like the last review noticed that the "Traveling librarian" wrote a completely ignorant review on this book. My first thought was wait a minute, that was not the book that I read. I read my copy once again and realized her entire review was fabricated. Then I knew, it was some kind of game. Maybe it is someone who dislikes the author for personal reasons, that has posted more then one awful review, or maybe this is another who is jealous, Who knows? All I know is that I liked the book, and future readers take the advice of the ignorant with a grain of salt.

review/text: This is a self-published book, and if you want to know why--read a few paragraphs! Those 5 star reviews must have been written by Ms. Haddon's family and friends--or perhaps, by herself! I can't imagine anyone reading the whole thing--I spent an evening with the book and a friend and we were in hysterics reading bits and pieces of it to one another. It is most definitely bad enough to be entered into some kind of a "worst book" contest. I can't believe Amazon even sells this kind of thing. Maybe I can offer them my 8th grade term paper on "To Kill a Mockingbird"--a book I am quite sure Ms. Haddon never heard of. Anyway, unless you are in a mood to send a book to someone as a joke---stay far, far away from this one!

That was funny but also sad that people are mean enough to keep others from an enjoyable read. I loved this book. I thought the first chapter was a little long, but I read the WHOLE book and I loved it. This book is about an afair of the heart and the right to be happy. It is a glimps into the lives of those who are forbiden to love each other. This is a heart warming story. This is a first book and it had a few flaws, but this writer will only get better and better as she goes forward. It was lovely and I am blessed that I read it.

review/summary: Wonderful
review/text: I really enjoyed the book. I believe the author did a good job at tackeling the subject of poor conduct in the church. I was reminded that we are all human, and even the mighty shall fall. Now I have to speak my mind regarding the poor reviews. I was shocked at the bahavior of "adults" What happened to respect for others. In my opinion I have to say those who wrote the mean reviews are nothing short of ignorent and without a doubt low class. Yes, there are minor errors in the book, but it did not change the greatness of the story for me. Who cares if a word on the back cover is missing an E? Did anyone stop to think that this book whent through a publisher most likely after it left the hands of Mrs, Haddon? I have to say, I am not one to leave reviews, but I just had too when I saw how this book was misrepresented. Not only was the author butchered, but those who liked the book as well were called illiterate. I agree with a fellow reviewer when I ask, how many of you have written a book? Obviously not many because you all have way too much time on your hands. I liked the book, and remember that those of you in glass houses should not throw stones.

review/text: I have to say that my friends at work all read this book and loved it. It was brought to our attention that there are negative reviews on this book that are false. For example the traveling librarian? We had a discussion about this book at work and the review of the traveling librarian is completely false. I pulled out the book and realized that these are lies and that someone is trying to ruin this book. The book never states that a garden is ten miles long. On page 62 it clearly states that the garden is five acres. No heartbeat of a fetus was heard at a week. How could it be? Julia was not even aware of the pregnancy at that time. The preacher never went to the house to give condolences, after reading the book once again it is obvious that he was there to fix the barn. So...on and ect... I also looked at the reviews &lt;history> all but one of the bad reviews is writen by someone who has never reviewed a book on amazon before. Veronica Haddon if you are reading this you need to write a letter to Amazon. Someon is playing a prank on you !!

review/summary: Wonderful, wonderful book !!
review/text: Just as predicted the first chapter of the book was long. I continued reading and then fell in love with WOTWS. It is heart warming and realistic. I thought it was a little depressing, but I quickly realized the writers point. There is a rainbow at the end of each storm. I did notice the error on the cover, but it only made me love the writer more. This writer is talented and she is not corporate, nor does it appear that she has a staff working for her. Her book was writen from the heart and that is what makes an American literary legend. I would rather read a book with an error then to read hollow perfection any day of the week.

review/text: I thought this book was brilliant, but yet realistic. It showed me that to error is human. I loved the fact that this writer showed the loving side of God and not the revengeful side of him. I loved how it twisted and turned and I could not put it down. I also loved The glass castle.

review/summary: Oh please
review/text: I guess you have to be a romance novel lover for this one, and not a very discerning one. All others beware! It is absolute drivel. I figured I was in trouble when a typo is prominently featured on the back cover, but the first page of the book removed all doubt. Wait - maybe I'm missing the point. A quick re-read of the beginning now makes it clear. This has to be an intentional churning of over-heated prose for satiric purposes. Phew, so glad I didn't waste $10.95 after all.

review/summary: Awful beyond belief!
review/text: I feel I have to write to keep others from wasting their money. This book seems to have been written by a 7th grader with poor grammatical skills for her age! As another reviewer points out, there is a misspelling on the cover, and I believe there is at least one per chapter. For example, it was mentioned twice that she had a "lean" on her house. I was so distracted by the poor writing and weak plot, that I decided to read with a pencil in hand to mark all of the horrible grammar and spelling. Please don't waste your money. I too, believe that the good reviews must have been written by the author's relatives. I will not put much faith in the reviews from now on!

review/summary: You've got to hand it to the author...
review/text: I purchased this book after reading rave reviews of it included within a review of a really good book I'd read. Apparently, the author (or her friends and family) are placing reviews of good books and encouraging people to buy this book if you liked the one they were reviewing. Great marketing by the author. However, the author should probably stick to marketing and give up the idea of being a writer. This book could have been written by a middle-schooler. It is a self-published, self-edited (and extremely poorly edited, I might add), and self-promoted lame excuse for a novel. My eyes rolled constantly while reading this book. Just when I thought it couldn't get worse...it did. The best part of this book is the short length. There is no substance, no character development, and the plot (if there actually is one) is pathetic. I generally trust the reviewers on Amazon. I really feel duped for purchasing this book after reading about it in Amazon's readers' reviews. Don't waste your money. The author should have printed only enough copies for family and friends. The rest of the population should be spared having to read this drivel.

review/summary: You've got to be kidding!
review/text: It has been years since I've read a romance novel. If this is typical of the genre these days, I will never pick up another one. Not only is the plot contrived and juvenile, the writing shows the lack of skill expected only in a child's writing. Many of my seventh grade writing students would be embarrassed if this trash was attributed to them. "The bed squeaked slightly, but her husband was unmoved by the sharp squeaks from the bed as well as the howling noises caused by the wind that were surrounding him." Were the squeaks slight or sharp, and were she and her husband sleeping outside that the wind could be howling around him not the house? This is just one mangled sentence in a book filled with such tripe. If my criticism seems harsh, it's because I actually paid money for this book. What a waste!I would suggest that Miss Haddon go back to Junior High School and begin a serious course of writing instruction. Perhaps by the time she graduates from college she will have gained an understanding of good sentence construction, proper punctuation, and the value of using adjectives sparingly. And if she reads a great deal along the way, she might also learn how to construct a plausible plot.

I read a lot, and I always have. I don't usually like modern love stories, but I gave it a chance and found that I didn't want to put it down until I finished it. I look forward to reading her next book and no I'm not a family member or a friend. Just give her book a chance and you might just find that it really is pretty good.

review/summary: awful beyond belief
review/text: I can't remember the last time I read such a dire book. I howled with laughter all the way through, wondering how much worse it could get - and sure enough, it got worse. If the writing is bad, the plot is ludicrous. A preacher comes to offer condolences the same afternoon that the heroine's husband is shot dead. Within moments they are having sex. The sex is not sensually treated or beautifully described - no, all they do is stick their tongues down each other's throats. The preacher goes to tell his paralysed wife. Her bizarre response - wait for it - is to stick her tongue down his throat. No wonder he veers away. The heroine runs off to work in the heart of Liverpool in a rose garden ten miles long (I kid you not). Did I mention she is dying? But never mind, she'll make a miraculous recovery. She meets another man - even though, conveniently, he's dying too, and she's pregnant by the preacher by now (and, oh joy, she hears the heartbeat of the fetus at a week... truly, a miracle)! The other man lives in castle and is very rich. Of course. They consumate their affair when she sticks her tongue down his throat. Not to worry, she doesn't have to perform this crude tonsil-tickling for long. The preacher turns up again. Everyone in the way drops dead, leaving the coast free for the "wicked saints" of the title to romp without blame or shame into the sunset.I could have kicked myself for buying this book; but I had been fooled by reading a mention of it by a so-called reviewer of The Mermaid Chair (which is a good book.) Then I checked all the other reviews done by reviewers of Ms Haddon's book (you can click on "other reviews" to see what I mean) and believe I have spotted a scam. The reviewers appear to have chosen the same half dozen best sellers to review -- each on the same day! - and in each review of these other genuinely good books they mention Wicked Saints in the most glowing terms. This is cynical piggy-back riding on bona fide books, made worse because this is a very badly edited (and badly written) self published book. I hope few people will be fooled as I was - and as Amazon has been. Be warned!

review/summary: The Best Soundtrack By SquareSoft
review/text: Yes indeed, the game was beautiful. Too bad no one really knows about it. When i played the game I absolutely loved it. A true masterpiece one of squaresofts best by far. But when I got the Soundtrack it was mind blowing. Every Song was on it. Plus the caftsmanship from the director was just overwhelming. The game and soundtrack by far are the best in squaresofts history. Never has there been a great combination. From Listening threw out Disc one which features some really cool Resident Evil only in symphony mode. Yes this Soundtrack is by far the best Video Game soundtrack that I have ever gotten. All I have to say is get the game first once you beat it. Get the soundtrack next. You'll know what I mean by what a true RPG game and music is all about.

review/text: The only critiscm I have about this sound track are the two bonus tracks (which don't appear in the game and add nothing to the preceding tracks on the cds) and the strange morph that one of the tracks (I believe that it is Escape) takes, turning from a good piece of music into something that seems to have escaped from the eighties.Apart from that I can't recommend this OST highly enough, especially Disc 2 - Track 29 -Staff Roll which, unlike the other tracks on the disc, is an acoustic Strings Piece that really shows off Hitoshi Sakimoto's talents as a composer.

review/summary: One of the very best video game soundtracks every
review/text: When I heard the first few tracks of this OST in an ill-fated battle track contest, I can't say I was too impressed. They seemed to be rather bland and even downright boring. However, I used to also think the same thing about the Final Fantasy Tactics soundtrack, which I now adore. That, and I'm not the type to give up on an entire soundtrack after listening to just a few songs once or twice.That said, I took it upon myself to find the Vagrant Story soundtrack, and I forced myself to listen to it. Several times. Dozens of times even. I played it on the PC. In the car, and my portable players. Eventually, it began to grow on me. I began to appericiate its incredibly dark ambience, its undeniable intelligence, the wonderful quality of the synth, and the sheer complexity of the compositions, a delight for people like me who like to analyze things.I think I first realized "I love this soundtrack" when I felt shivers running down my spine while listening to the end of "Climax of the Grayland Case." How beautiful! Or maybe it was when it thought to myself "That heavy piano playing really does remind me of iron!" while listening to "Iron Crab". Or perhaps it was when I was listening to "Staff Roll" and it made my day a little happier when the main melody kicked in at around 4:25.Or perhaps it was a combination of all of these factors and more, or maybe something else entirely, that I can't really describe. All I can know for sure is that this soundtrack has easily become my second favorite soundtrack, with only FFVI's soundtrack being better in my eyes.I wish I could find a better way to describe exactly how I feel about this soundtrack, but I'm just not eloquent enough. That being said, I think I will give some very short reviews of my favorite tracks.1. Climax of the Grayland Case/IncidentThis is what game music should be! How truly epic! This track showcases pretty much all of the styles that will be used in the rest of the game. The highlight for me is at the end when in the game the sun rises over the edge of the broken stained glass window to the sound of one lone trumpet fanfare. Brilliant. You really just have to see it in context at least once to understand.2. Snowfly ForestThe is my second favorite forest theme, second only to "The Calm Before the Storm" from FFX. It's much less dissonant than the rest of the tracks, but not really very melodic either. It sounds like something out of a fairy tale... a very distorted fairy tale. Some of the parts toward the end almost sound Persian.3. Iron CrabThis is by far my favorite battle track. I've never actually played the game this far but just listening to the music I can picture in my head a giant Iron Crab, snapping and lunging. The heavy, low piano provides the iron, and the brass and percussion provide the crab, I think.4. Staff RollThis has to be the best game ending ever. Honestly, I think it's good enough to be the credits role for a high quality film. The best part is when the main melody kicks in at around 4:20 or so.Other great tracks I like include: Wyvern, Bloody Sin, The Last of Rosencrantz-Curly, Headquarters of the VKP, Dark Element, and Limestone Quarry.All in all a very, very good soundtrack, so much more than just "Video Game Music", and really much closer to a film score. A 10/10 for sure.

review/summary: Great buy!
review/text: I purchased a different jacket when I first got my motorcycle, but I only used it for about six months before needing a new one. In my local shop, they had no plus-sized women's jackets, so I was wearing a men's jacket, and the plates weren't in good places to be protective in case of an accident. This jacket runs true to size, and seems more durable than the other brand of jacket I had (Joe Rocket). The two separate zip-out liners are very convenient and easy. I am very happy with the fit and quality. I ride about two hours a day, on the interstate, and my old jacket started to fray at certain seams after only a month or so. I have had this one for over a month, and there are no signs of wear. In addition, the jacket is comfortable from 95 degrees down to 50 degrees (with appropriate clothing underneath, of course). It may work in even colder weather, but I haven't ridden in anything colder than 50. Overall, I'm really, really pleased with this purchase!

If anything could be a "con" its the zippers...when the linings are out, there are a lot of zippers exposed and I often try to zip the wrong ones! The liners are great....keep you dry, keep off the wind, or keep you warm. I have no complaints. The jacket may be short for some people...but I'm very short-waisted and it fits me perfect. I sized up 1 size and it is quite comfortable.

As is often the case she 'finds' herself through honest, often comical but always emotional, interaction with this sizzling roster of players.

review/summary: interplay of traditions across Caribbean
review/text: from publisher:Addresses the interplay of diverse spiritual, religious, and cultural traditions across the Caribbean.Dealing with the ongoing interaction of rich and diverse cultural traditions from Cuba and Jamaica to Guyana and Surinam, Nation Dance addresses some of the major contemporary issues in the study of Caribbean religion and identity. The book's three sections move from a focus on spirituality and healing, to theology in social and political context, and on to questions of identity and diaspora.The book begins with the voices of female practitioners and then offers a broad, interdisciplinary examination of Caribbean religion and culture. Afro-Caribbean religions, Hinduism, Judaism, Islam, and Christianity are all addressed, with specific reflections on Santer&iacute;a, Palo Monte, Vodou, Winti, Obeah, Kali Mai, Orisha work, Spiritual Baptist faith, Spiritualism, Rastafari, Confucianism, Congregationalism, Pentecostalism, Catholicism, and liberation theology. Some essays are based on fieldwork, archival research, and textual or linguistic analysis, while others are concerned with methodological or theoretical issues. Contributors include practitioners and scholars, some very established in the field, others with fresh, new approaches; all of them come from the region or have done extensive fieldwork or research there. In these essays the poetic vitality of the practitioner's voice meets the attentive commitment of the postcolonial scholar in a dance of "nations" across the waters.

review/summary: Ecclesiological Milestone
review/text: With the publication of Everett Ferguson's book on ecclesiology, another milestone has been reached in the scholarly presentation of the distinctive theological perspective of Churches of Christ. The book is divided into six chapters, each roughly sixty to seventy pages in length. Within each chapter, Ferguson neatly and systematically outlines his thoughts and arguments. The first chapter, entitled "The People and the Messiah: History and Eschatology," deals mainly with background issues. It examines the Old Testament teaching on the importance of covenant and the meaning of the phrase "kingdom of God" in its relationship to an and distinction from the church. Ferguson enters into the New Testament and ecclesiology proper via a consideration of Jesus as Messiah, including a careful exegesis of Matt. 16:13-23, where he concludes that the "rock" of Matt. 16:18 is not Peter, but the fact of Jesus' Messiahship. Ferguson's analysis of Matt. 16:13-23 is insightful and carefully articulated. Within this section, he gives attention to "the gates of Hades will not prevail" and concludes with some interesting yet encouraging insight. In the second chapter, "The Church and Her Lord: The Nature of the Church," Ferguson deals with and focuses on three images, "people of God," "body of Christ," and "community of the Spirit." A peculiar feature in this chapter is placing the discussion of the word ekklesia last rather than first. The latter would seem more appropriate and would seem to set the stage for the chapter, especially for a work of biblical ecclesiology. This great section will open the eyes of the reader and renew his focus of church. That is to say, this chapter correctly puts Christ as the head of the church and gives Him His appropriate place. The third chapter concentrates on, "The Church and Her Savior: Salvation and Church Membership." Essentially this section covers soteriology, which determines ecclesiology, but it is not ecclesiology itself. His full treatment of the nature of sin, the meaning of the cross, and the human response to God's saving work is only loosely linked to his topic of ecclesiology. This is not to say that this section is uninteresting or uninformative because it is quite helpful for a fuller understanding of these matters. Far more important is the content of Ferguson's soteriology. Ferguson is strong when it comes to the necessity of baptism. A few statements will give the reader an idea of his position: "Baptism is the time at which one is incorporated into Christ and so becomes a child of God" (pg. 170); "Baptism is a `calling on the name' of the Lord" (pg. 180); and, "Baptism is the appointed time at which God pronounces forgiveness" (pg. 183). He concludes: There must be an objective necessity about baptism, or New Testament writers could not speak of baptism in the way they do" (pg. 185). How refreshing! In our world of relativity and ecumenism, people need to hear Ferguson's words, especially those in Churches of Christ. The last three chapters move into a more familiar territory for a treatise on the church. Chapter four, "The Church and Her High Priest: Worship and Assembly" is a great section for anyone interested in the dynamics of worship. Here, Ferguson begins with a type of etymology as a way of introduction, concentrating on both the Greek and English words. This introduction to the subject sets the stage for the entire chapter. Worship is a hot topic today, thus chapter four is rather applicable for our day with all the differing views. This section is multitudinously faceted and exhaustive. "The Church and Her Bishop: The Continuing Ministry" is appropriately the title for the fifth chapter. In this section, Ferguson again touches on some hot topics in the church. It is unfortunate however that he only briefly deals with the debates on miraculous gifts and women's roles. Ferguson advocates a cessasionist position on miraculous gifts and a complementarian position on women's roles, but leaves the reader thirsting for more information and a more comprehensive treatment of the issues. In a day where these two in particular issues are so widely discussed and debated, one would think that they might have received a little concentration. Again, this is not to eradicate what was accomplished in this chapter because it was insightful and obliging, especially given the fact that his discussion on deaconesses was amazingly insightful and well balanced. In chapter six Ferguson adequately covers, "The Church and Her Teacher: The New Way of Life." In this section, he includes an unusually prominent consideration of ethics and a very healthy discussion of the importance of Christian fellowship and its concomitant, church discipline. One last thing that must be mentioned about this chapter is Ferguson's section on unity. Although this section is brief, it is significant and insightful. Ferguson lays out the various aspects of unity and does so in just a few short pages. It serves as an excellent conclusion to a monumental work. Of course, any reader is free to take issue with some of Ferguson's conclusions. For example, the distinction that is made between the temporary and permanent endowments of the Spirit still awaits additional clarification, and there will be those who will score Ferguson, despite his disclaimer, for his synchronic rather than diachronic approach to the New Testament writings. This is a courageous book. Its Reformed-Restorationist slant that the proper doctrine of the church entails a return to the faith and practice of the apostolic church is unmistakable. There are numerous nuggets of exegesis and important points of emphases that make this book worth reading. It is astounding that Ferguson deals with so many facets of ecclesiology in a one-volume work. Not only that, but he also includes a helpful subject index as well as a number of bibliographies. Just a glance at his copious footnotes and it is clear that this book is well researched and well documented. This book should be one that every minister, church leader, and ministry student is required to read and ponder.

review/summary: Early Christian development of the Church
review/text: Everett Ferguson approaches the subject of early christian development with quotes from their early documents in their own words. Ferguson gives us a peek into the minds of early Christians and puts it together in a form one can understand today. The only criticism is that he can get too technical and detailed at times. With patience his writing is able to be followed by a serious student of the subject of God's church. I highly recommend this book for any serious student of the subject!

review/summary: Fashionable Compression Stockings!
review/text: After I had a DVT my doctor required me to wear compression stockings. I wore ugly white TED hose and yucky thick brown stockings. Then I found Jobst UltraSheer. They gave me the compression I needed (15-20,) but looked like regular pantyhose. Even though my blood clot has been gone for 4 years, I still buy these to wear as support stockings because they make my legs feel so nice.**Note, I have problems with the rubberized tops rolling down my thigh. I tried the Jobst adhesive, but I hated having my skin pulled all day. I bought an inexpensive garter belt and it works fine and helps keep the stockings from rolling.

review/text: Excellent product. However, they are very difficult to get on for older people. I feel like I've had a full day workout after getting them on. Also, as the day wears on, they begin to roll down from the top and create a very deep ridge in the skin. I have to wear them, so if those two difficulties could be addressed it would be such a help.

Both pair of these also tore as I struggled to pull them up all the time. Good riddance/bad investment!

review/text: Who was Saint Hyacinth? The story starts with a chance meeting in Rome where he witnesses (the future) Saint Dominic raising a man from death. From that point the book is one miracle and amazing encounter on Hyacinth's journey across North Europe. He raised the dead, walks on water, fled the invading Tatars from a Cathedral carrying a 500 lb. Statue. All thoughout he dispenses his own brand of spiruatilty and humility. The book reads liks a combination of a self help book like the One minute Manager and the excitement of the Raiders of the Lost Arc. Kids will love this book to be read to them. They will never forget Saint Hyacinth. I know I never will.

If you are used to the convenience of the cookie dough that you buy wrapped up in plastic logs then you might be in for a bit of a surprise. Mixing up the dough can get VERY messy (it is extremely sticky). However, with a cookie mix like this you have a lot of flexibility in the ratio of ingredients (I like to add some extra butter to make the baked cookies more chewy). Also, this mix has really large chocolate chips in it--I love that.I removed a star for the addition of 'natural flavors' in the mix.

It's great looking (I bought the Clear Bubbly one), super-simple to use, and most importantly, produced a beautiful, long-lasting foamy froth. (I use Simply Smart fat-free milk and am very pleased with the results.) Once you've got the foam you want, you can simply remove the metal screen mechanism and pop the jar in the microwave to warm the milk. Delicious!I have a crazy phobia about letting milk sit around for any length of time at room temperature, so if I'm going to use the Foamagic more than once during the day - and I typically do -- I rinse it well with water. I've put it in the dishwasher with good results, but think I'll be handwashing it as much as possible -- I'd hate to see the acrylic crack because of the temperature of my dishwasher.

The surrounding countryside and 'old home' scenes are set with early morning ground mists or the haze of memory while the events on the bridge and in the water are bright, clear, and immediate.Here everything is dull, dark, and clouded. Or, if you remember the timbre and enunciation of Captain's commands, so are the visuals.After that, it is hard to believe this award winning, critically acclaimed film's best presentation is on YOUTUBE. Somewhere "out there" is a DVD that comes up to the standard of a 16mm public library reel.Just none of them appear to be on Amazon.

review/summary: A twist (in the wind) ending
review/text: Besides his famousDEVIL'S DICTIONARY, San Francisco newpaperman Ambrose Gwinnett Bierce (1842-1914) wrote many supernatural and Civil War short stories. AN OCCURENCE AT OWL CREEK BRIDGE is best-known of the latter. This French-made short film (28 mins.) of that tale was required viewing in high schools back in the 1960s.The story opens with Confederate sympathizer Peyton Farquhar being executed by hanging from the titled river span. He's pushed, falls, the rope snaps and Peyton lands in the water, unharmed. He manages to free his hands, untie his bound feet and safely escape from a barrage of rifle fire.For a day and night Farquhar flees through an endless forest in the general direction of home-- some 30 miles distant. All through this taxing journey he thinks about wife and kids. Peyton begins to imagine strange sights and noises, and is convinced that he dozes even while walking. After coming to full consciousness near his home, Farquhar runs (in stunning slow motion) with arms outstretched toward his wife. He suddenly feels a blinding pain in the back of his neck...The literary device central to "Owl Creek Bridge" has been reused in many films.JACOB'S LADDER(1990) andCARNIVAL OF SOULS(1962) are just two of these.Licensee of this indie transfer, VIDEO YESTERYEAR (along with RADIO YESTERYEAR) is a specialty company located in Sandy Hook, CT.

review/text: Steven Wardell's book is a pure delight and I've recommended itto friends of all ages. In Rising Sons and Daughters, we learn thatJapanese young people are preserving their country's tradition of respect for their elders while also creating their own identity as Japan's &quot;Generation X&quot;. Like our own young people, they are bombarded with some of the excesses of &quot;Western culture&quot; - Clothing fads, rock groups, a culture of shopping, etc. What they seem to be developing, however, is a healthy hybrid of old and new that retains a firm foundation in good values. The Ando family members are wonderful, memorable people and Stevern Wardell writes poignantly about their lives and hopes of each of them.

review/summary: A fascinating insight into the life of modern Japanese teens
review/text: I thoroughly enjoyed Rising Sons and Daughters. I don't know of any other book that looks at Japanese society from the point of view of its young people poised as they are between their parents' age-old Japanese culture of restraint and obedience to the will of the community, and their peers' adulation of Western culture. True to form, the &quot;New Young&quot; of Japan seem to be creating an &quot;international&quot; blend, as the Ando family demonstrates in this beautifully written book of vignettes of the private lives of members of this family. Steven Wardell is clearly a talented young author, adopted for some of his schooling into this family of four teens, and thus able to view family life in Japan from the inside out. A great read!

review/summary: Almost a day by day view
review/text: Steven Wardell went to Japan without reading any of the hundreds of books about Japan. He went without any idea of how Japan would treat him. So what he writes seems to come to us without much editing by any pre-made belief. No filters are between us and the experiences he had day to day. All the details about school, family life and learning the language comes to us without any forethought.Compared to other books on Japan this is raw, unmolded, information and is full of insight that I doubt even Wardell realized was amazing for such a young writer. I would say that this is a must for anybody planning on going to Japan for ANY reason.Did find some humor in the fact that Wardell felt the need to explain everything, even what a corn dog was, and that when he met other exchange students one complained about how the Japanese, and I quote, Couldn't even speak English good, end of quote. Couldn't even speak English GOOD? Neither can the exchange students it seems.All in all, you need to get it. Used, paperback, in hardcover, any version you can. Just get it.

review/summary: No roy Orbison fan should be without this!
review/text: First of all, Roy's studio recordings of the 60's were absolute marvels, production masterpieces of their time, and all time. But Roy was also no slouch live, as Black and White Night proved, once and for all. These recordings are of surprisingly good sound quality, and Roy is in good form throughout. If you're a Roy fan, don't hesitate; the price is great and it's all very listenable. Given an extra star because it's NOT overpriced. I wish the corporate giants would take note: it is not necessary to gauge the buyer on old reissues or old &quot;found&quot; material. You'll sell more, which means in the long run, make more. Get it?

review/summary: reasonably priced. reasonably worth it.
review/text: i was leary of this set. if you look at the track listing, you'll notice that there's is an awful lot of repeated material. if you read between the lines, the boxed set warns you of this, boasting that each concert contains "all of orbison's biggest hits," and it is the case that just over half of each cd is repeated material. with boxed sets, i usually like to go disc-by-disc and discuss the merits and flaws of each one, but that seems sort of unnecessary here. suffice to say, there are a few things to keep in mind with this set:first of all, keep in mind that these are "authorized BOOTLEGS", which means that the recordings don't have the most exceptional sound quality. this is the time when having bought that really nice stereo is going to pay off. listening to these bootlegs through a nice big set of speakers with an equalizer and whatnot is going to buy you some extra quality that just isn't there when you're listening through three inch computer speakers (as i'm doing now). that being said, only one of the shows sounds certifiably dreadful (the 1980 show at Stockton) and that is forgivable since there's another disc in the set from the very same year. oddly, the two earlier shows ('69 and '75) are best sounding, though logic dictates that advances in bootleg technology would happen the same way that advances in everything else does.secondly, remember that roy's songs were - typically - heavy on string arrangements that it would have been difficult to duplicate in a live show. the two 1980 concerts feature some lame keyboard parts, but the hokey electronics aren't really overpowering and are easy to look past. for the most part, the arrangements relied on a couple of guitars, bass, piano, and drums. consequently, the songs always sound much more stripped down to their bones than the studio recordings. this isn't a bad thing, necessarily, but one could argue that the "orbison sound" was indebted to those heavy, dramatic, orchestral arrangements, and that the songs lack some of their majesty when played as a five-piece.thirdly, as mentioned before, look at the track listing. EVERY disc contains "only the lonely". every one contains "pretty woman". every one has "crying". you may or may not think that you need that many versions of the same songs, especially since orbison's delivery of them rarely deviates (in form or quality). ask yourself, "will i listen to 'candyman' over and over again, or is this maybe just a little excessive?"fourth, orbison was a steady performer, but not terribly charismatic. furthermore, his music didn't lend itself to wild eyed pandamonium or frantic rock and roll shenanigans. he performs every show with a kind of austere dignity, never giving a bad performance, but also never getting too caught up in the songs that he's singing.fifth, the liner notes here are sparse, but adequate. each disc contains a little bit of information about the particular show, but nothing to involved about orbison's life, or why his live performances were unique or special. that being said, the set is lovingly packaged, with unifying artwork and design between each individual disc. it's obvious that this set - packaged and distributed by the orbison estate - was designed to look professional and respectful of an artist of orbison's caliber (unlike the 4-disc "Legendary Roy Orbison" set which sony carelessly assembled and tossed off without interest an interest in orbison's legacy).finally there's the price. this is where the set is absolved of all of it's flaws. amazon claims that the set lists for something like [price], but i found my copy at a national chain store ... for [price], which means that even if there were only two discs worth of listenable material, i'd still only be paying about [price] per cd, which is pretty normal. my only real complaint about the purchase was that the earliest show was from '69, and that there were two shows from '80. i would've preferred something more varied: after all, that's only 11 years for a man whose career was practically three times as long as that.dedicated orbison fans shouldn't miss this one. he was pop's master balladeer, and he's always in exquisite form here, even when the other factors (recording quality, repetition of material, etc.) don't do him justice. there was never a singer like him before, and there hasn't been once since.

review/summary: ORBISON'S MUSICAL TIME MACHINE
review/text: Roy Orbison was one of those rare vocalists whose live performance could equal and indeed surpass his recorded work.So it is with this superb collection of recordings from various concert performances.There is,of necessity,repetition of the tracks.Orbison fans came to hear the great songs and Roy gave them what they came for.Few artists could sustain a whole show with nothing but their own self-composed million-sellers like the Big 'O'.Listening to these recordings transports me back to the magic of a Roy Orbison concert.Hear the beautiful sweeping power of his voice,the death-defying leaps on the highest notes,the poetry of his lyrics.From disc to disc their are subtle nuances,little changes in emphasis,inflexion and tone.Throughout there is sheer brilliance of the highest order.

review/text: I recently bought this charger kit from Amazon and I am quite happy with my purchase. The folding plug is nice for storage. The included 1850 mAh batteries last for a long time in my Nikon Coolpix 2100. One of the best features of the charger is that each battery is charged separately (as opposed to in pairs) so that each battery gets just the right amount of charge. The short 3 hour charge time is great as well. The batteries do not get overly warm while charging either.Overall, this is a good charger for a good price. If you have a high drain device, the Kodak K2000 should keep you playing for a long time.

This charger even charges up my SONY AA batteries that came with the camera.Highly recommended!

review/summary: Problem with charging smaller AAAs
review/text: I have had the charger for more than two years. It charges AA batteries just fine, but has a huge problem securing smaller AAA batteries. To charge the smaller batteries you need to flip down the little button at the positive end. In the beginning one of the four AAA batteries would pop up, and now three out of the four won't hold. The problem is the flip mechanism became loose, and any horizontal pressure would push the buttons back up. What I have to do now is using duct tape and a segment of crayon, apply the crayon on the buttons, and wrap the tape around. You know how painful that is.

I just kept it since it does charge...but the lights are useless since they seem to always stay on.

review/text: This is simpily the best rechargable batteries I have ever own!But there is a slight issue in which is the reason why I have to return this for something else - different mAh ratings!The charger comes with 1700mAh Batteries!!! Not 1850!!!!!!I purchase this for use in my GPS/GMRS radios (which eats 3 per unit). So natually, I purchase this charger with extra Kodak Max K2000 batteries (same product name, and pretty looks the same in picture) but the problem is that the extra set is rated at 1850! I was planning to use those on my gps, but if the ratings are different, my data between the units might be incorrect.Bottom line, if 4 batteries are all you need, or you can use them in sets of 2 or all 4 at once. GO FOR IT!!! I am a gadget freak and I test many different products frequently. When it comes to batteries - this is it, hands down.

Another plus is that the plug folds under when not in use. That makes the unit even more compact and the plug is less likely to scratch something when stored away.

review/summary: Great Compact Charger
review/text: I need a fast, compact charger that could easily fit into my digital camera bag. Other chargers are compact, BUT the electric cord takes up a lot of room. This charger DOES NOT have an electric cord to contend with, Instead, it has a collapsable plug, which folds completely hidden into the unit when not in use, allowing it to be placed neatly into the camera bag pocket.With the storage issue taken care of, the performance of this unit is above expectations. The recharging process is less than 3 hours. Unlike other models, you can recharge either one, two three or all four batteries at once and still get a full charge on all batteries. The two battery option is nice for my kids walkie-talkie batteries. The shut down mode when complete is a nice option that is really needed, especially for the time when you forget about the charger until the next morning.I've tried several other chargers and this is the BEST model that I have worked with. Compact, easy storage, fast charging, auto shutdown, charge less than 4 at a time. ALL the options I need for a battery charger.

review/summary: Fast Charges; Long Lasting Power--but weak spring mechanism.
review/text: The charger makes quick work out of charging all four batteries simultaneously, and automatically shuts off when finished, which is very convenient--no more burned out batteries.Also, the batteries, 1850 mAH, which come with this charger seem to be the highest rated you can buy, and do last very long. Just out of the box, without prior charging, they already outperfomed the Alkalines I had been using previously in my Canon A70. Definately a great buy.One complaint, however, is that the springs that come down to hold smaller AAAs in place break too easily, and will not firmly hold AAAs in place while charging. This has absolutely no affect on Double A batteries, but is an annoyance when trying to charge triple A batteries. It will still charge them, but it's a hassle trying to get the batteries to stay in place when the clip does not hold them sturdily.Overall, a sufficient battery charger. If you are just using it to charge AAs, this is perfect. If you will primarily be charging AAAs, I would look into a different charger, perhaps one that does not involve spring-loading holding mechanisms at all.

review/text: After reading the reviews, I bought this charger. It is everything the positive reviewers are saying. It is simple to use, just fold out the electric prongs and plug into a wall outlet or extension cord. In 3 hours, up to 4 NiMH AA batteries are charged (you can charge 1 to 4 batteries at a time). This charger will shut itself off when it is done charging--in 3 hours. It has lights for each battery telling you when it is charging and the lights go out to let you know that the batteries are fully charged. Since the electric prongs can fold in, the charger can easily fit into a camera bag, or pocket. It is about 2-1/2" by 5" (inches) in dimension. This is an excellent product!!!

review/text: I bought this charger to go with my handheld Garmin GPS unit. Once I got this unit, I did some testing using Energizer batteries. I did a full charge of these batteries and they ran as long if not a bit longer than the Energizer batteries. So once you calculate that these can be charged 800 times, they are a MUCH better deal than buying normal batteries all the time. I also bought a 4 pack of the 1850mAh batteries because all the reviews said the charger came with 1700's and the 1850's were that much better. They were wrong, the charger came with 4 1850's so save your[money]on the extra pack.

review/text: I have really enjoyed using these 1850 NiMH Batteries - they last quite a long time in my A70 digital camera and CD player and the charge time is very quick compared to others. Plus, the fact that you can charge each battery individually is very nice, since it prevents overcharging of any battery. Others charge 2 batteries at once and that assumes that both need to charge as long as the other. Also, the charger works well with AA and AAA NiCad and NiMH batteries. Great buy...

review/text: I just bought this battery charger a few months ago and it works PERFECTLY with my Canon PowerShot A60. It charges up to 4 AA or AAA batteries in LESS THAN 3 HOURS ALL THE TIME!The charger is small and easily portable so you can bring it with you anywhere for quick charging.The only downside to the charger I have found so far is that you can't leave it in the outlet overnight or it will overheat, so you have to come back to it in 3-4 hours. Other than that, this is THE charger to buy!

review/summary: To "Disappointed" in Miami
review/text: You said "...but the charge only lasts a very short time."Did you know that new Ni-MH batteries must be cycled 3 to 5 times before they hold a full charge? This does not mean that they should be charged 3 to 5 times in a row but rather that for the first 3 to 5 charge/discharge cycles, the batteries reach a higher charge level each time until they are recharged until they finally reach their rated capacity. This may be your problem. Try doing this and you might be pleasantly surprised.

review/summary: Excellent
review/text: This is an excellent book. It offers the opinions of a diverse sample of real Muslim Women with very different attitudes. It will not appeal to those who don't want to listen or who want an anti-islamic feminist political tract. The value of this is that you hear the opinions, educated and not, of the real people involved.Most of the time, the real voices are ignored and what is presented in the name of feminism is non-muslim american female TV personalities yacking endlessly on about the lives and experiences of people they really don't know and don't want to know.What must be understood above all else is that if you wish to change a society or a culture, you must at the very least understand how the people in that culture who disagree with you think. That is what this book does so well. I may not agree at all with the opinion of every woman in the book, but I at least understand how they think after finishing it.What many will never understand is that Islamic Society has changed and is still changing. But it can only change by consensus from within. No amount of cultural imperialism from western countries is going to change anything for the better.There is also more than a little hypocracy. For all the lectures about the veil from American Women, few of them stop to think about why they are themselves forced into certain choices. A veil isn't great, but its a whole lot more confortable than the pantyhose that many Western women must wear effectively as a condition of employment. One wonders at a certain point if its the veil itself they object to or that as constrasted to their money-driven appearance decisons, the veil has a meaning beyond the secular.

review/text: I was excited to find a book ostensibly about Muslim feminism, but this volume did not live up to the expectations.One essay, among other things, describes the veil as potentially liberating. It doesn't begin to explain how or why.Another, on Muslim women in Cape Town, claims that Muslim women there are separate but "more than equal." Gee whiz, what a disappointment.I had expected and hoped for at least one Muslim feminist condemnation of gender apartheid. But there is not a single one in the book.I'm surprised it didn't have an essay extolling the virtues of female genital mutilation.--Alyssa A. Lappen

review/text: Although written with script authors et al in mind, Dramatica for Screenwriters is the perfect companion book for Dramatica: A New Theory of Story.Using witty and easy to understand examples, the author takes you systematically through the process of turning a meager idea into a full-blown, grand argument story via Dramatica Theory definitions. With a slight mental adjustment, the tips and advice in this book fit the novelist's dilemma as well as the screenwriter's. If you are exploring the world of Dramatica, you need this book on your shelf.

review/text: Sorry for any mistake I could do here, English is not my first language.While Dramatica is a powerful tool for building a story, it is complex and sometimes overwhelming. Armando Salda&ntilde;a-Mora found a way to demystify Dramatica and give a lot of practical advices and principles for creating a story with Dramatica."Dramatica for Screenwriters" is easy to understand, fun and thought-provoking. The only drawback is that this book is not useful if you do not know the Dramatica Theory or do not use Dramatica software. Now, if you're a Dramatica user or if you plan to seriously evaluate the software, it is a must-have.

review/summary: Thoroughly Confusing
review/text: I purchased this book based on the other reviews claiming that it "demystifies" the Dramatica theory and software. Unfortunately, I found the opposite to be the case.I've made numerous attempts to get my head around the principles of the Dramatica theory, with the intention of finally being able to put to use the rather pricey Dramatica Pro software I bought years ago. Both the software itself, and the book of theory explaining it ("Dramatica: A New Theory of Story") are so riddled with specialized (and somewhat proprietary) jargon that I've long counted myself among the number of users for whom the effort to grasp the principles involved outweighed the potential benefits. (And BTW, I'm no newcomer to the basic premises of story structure; I've got an MFA from a respectable film school, and have worked for many years as a film editor.)I'd had high hopes for "Dramatica For Screenwriters", figuring it would serve as a practical layman's guide to understanding and using the software. Unfortunately (there's that word again), despite claims in the author's introduction to the contrary, a few pages in the jargon begins coming at the reader hot and heavy, and unlike in "Dramatica: A New Theory of Story", which I already found to be too opaque, here much of the jargon is not even explained in a cursory manner. Reader familiarity is assumed, which would seem to defeat the purpose of the book in the first place. So the reader is left with a bit of a Catch-22: if you need the book, you probably won't understand it, and if you can understand the book, you probably don't need it.

review/summary: Practical Guide to a Complicated Process
review/text: Dramatica is a pain in the ass to learn. The main book is dense, repetitive, dilatory and slow. DRAMATICA FOR SCREENWRITERS is the opposite! The writing flows easily. It's directs you to the easiest possible paths for getting started. It encourages you to take action and walks you through it. It provides good theoretical guidance without getting bogged down.This is the book that should come with the software for everyone, not just screenwriters. It gives anyone who reads it the ability to jump into A STORY and get it done. Once you've gotten A STORY done you can use Dramatica to alter it for it's media (you may need the main book to get you there). You can also get more stories done with it. Dramatica is not intuitive software. You need to use it from a number of angles to get the hang of it. DRAMATICA FOR SCREENWRITERS gets you there. The main Dramatica book doesn't. READ THIS BOOK FIRST.

review/summary: Even as a fiction writer, I found this book invaluable
review/text: I think the hardest thing for people coming to Dramatica the first time is understanding that the theory and software are not designed to write your story for you (or tell you what your story is about), but rather to tell you, based on the way you answer all the hundreds of questions, what the best storyform or context is from which to tell your story in the way you want.[...]I did the work to know the theory, but "Dramatica for Screenwriters" really helped me understand it. Even though I am a fiction writer and not a screenwriter, I found that most of this book applies to any kind of fictional world building. I highly recommend it.Don't buy the book thinking it's going to take the place of doing the work of getting to know the theory. It assumes prior knowledge.

review/summary: Good structure makes good bones for story
review/text: Beauty is in the bones. This book gives your story good bones, and you end up knowing why. It is a clear explanation of how to do the structure of a story so the end product is a top model. You have to supply the writing, a big commitment, but you won't have the feeling when you're done that something is incomplete or wrong - and all your work goes to something which misses the mark.We have all seen too many movies where the verdict is "Interesting!" To a writer, this is deadly. It means that all the work of director and actors and film crew, editors and producers, went for naught because the starting place, the script, had the final flaws buried in its pages. Use this book and your story will have a coherence and an internal logic that will be solid and subtle - and when you put on it the forensic anthopologist's 'layer of flesh,' what will stare back at you will be a thing of beauty.

Even if you aren't a native speaker like me, having german as my mother tongue. I would never have made it with the DRAMATICA SOFTWARE if I haven't had this book. Believe me. It's worth every Cent (I payed in Euro). Though I tried very hard for roundabout 2 years I was coming to fail with Dramatica 4.0. This book saved my ass. Let it save yours too. It's making me happy.

review/summary: Does what it says it will
review/text: This is a nice combo DVD/VCR. I've had it for a couple of years now and have had no problems. That's really why I'm writing; I want to let people know the ones with problems are probably the exception rather than the rule.The only disadvantages to this product for me:1) On the VCR, you can't FF by time (a panasonic feature; FF a given number of minutes)2) Once you set the VCR program, you must hit TIMER (not just power off) to get it to use the program. Okay, hitting TIMER will turn the power off, but let's say you want to record something later in the week. You will turn your deck on and off several times in that period. Do you want to hit TIMER every time? And by the way, hitting TIMER doesn't just turn the deck off, it switches to DVD mode. In theory, this is nice so you can still use your DVD player while recording a show. In practice you just end up turning off two things (VCR via TIMER, DVD via power) most of the time.3) No S-video input. I had to buy a S-video to composite video adapter to record something from my PC video card. By the way, don't do this; the quality is pretty low.Little advantages to this product for me:1) Front panel inputs; I use this to dub from my video camera very often2) Comprehensive remote; for me, the more buttons the better. I hate on-screen menus. How can I see what the picture looks like when I adjust the tracking if 88% of the screen is the tracking menu?3) Many flavors of A/V OUTPUT: digital audio (coax and optical), composite video (of course), component video (nice for home theater), S video.Bottom line: A good combo deck for the money.

review/summary: Based on the reviews here I bought one and I'm glad I did!
review/text: This VCR/DVD was an early Christmas present to myself after deciding to join the rest of the world in DVD-land but not wanting to let go of my VHS movies quite yet. Based on the reviews and price, and because I own a JVC TV, this was my choice. I agree with the easy set-up. It's a bit awkward to work the whole TV/VHS/DVD selection options but I think I've gotten the hang of it.Two comments: it's not intuitive and actually is pretty complicated (too many buttons on the remote but that might please others who are more technically-minded than me) so I've had to rely heavily on the how-to manual. And setting the VCR timer is awkward -- you can't enter the start and end time but have to scroll (unless I'm missing something)...but those are my only complaints. This is a good product for your $$$.

review/summary: Great Combo Package!
review/text: I decided to wait over a year to write a review on this unit, and thankfully my opinion since the first day I got it hasn't changed. It's wonderful! I was suprised to find a full feature DVD player included. A friend of mine bought a relatively expensive DVD player and it didn't have some of the features this unit has (albeit its a bit smaller). I have never experienced performance issues while using the DVD player in 12+ months. Zoom feature comes in handy as well, if you rent DVDs and don't necessarily want the whole long apect ratio. VCR works great as well. Recordings done in SP look excellent, colors are great and its not grainy at all. EP recordings look great for being EP as well, if you sit back on the couch you can't tell the difference. Only problem there is sometimes it takes a few seconds to track with EP, but it normally finds the right setting fairly quickly. The remote is easy to use once you learn it. It can be confusing at first, but now I wouldn't use anything else. It can control all the TV functions as well at the combo unit. If you want to take a small step into the world of DVD players, but not let go of your old VHS tapes, this is the player for you. Especially now, with the price quite reduced from when I bought it. You will not be disappointed!

review/text: I've had this for just over a month. I had read other reviews on this product prior to purchasing, and to me it seemed like it had received good reviews as simple-to-use machine with good attribues for not-so-electronic-literate person like myself. It had been working just fine, until few days ago I was playing a DVD and all of a sudden it would freeze, and on the TV screen there would be many different colored squares, completely distorting the image. And now, the Dvd player does not even recognize any format (I've tried CDs, DVDs, and even VCDs), as it only says &quot;Incorrect Disc&quot;.I just now found another review where the person had the same problem, had to take it to a local service center, got fixed, came back, and the exact same problem popped back up three weeks later.Reading that, I don't even know if I want to even bother taking it to get it fixed. Since it still plays VHS perfectly fine, maybe I'll just invest in a simple DVD player, which defeats the whole purpose of why I bought a DVD/VHS combo player in the first place....

review/text: Overall, this player works great and was fairly easy to set up. However, the display is ugly (orange lettering that reminds me of my alarm clock) and only displays minutes, not seconds. Also, the lack of universal remote is a drawback. Finally, I was disappointed to learn that you can only record on the VCR in SP (2 hr) or EP (6 hour) speeds. Maybe this is standard now, but I've always liked LP mode for taping movies so you could fit two on a tape. This stuff may seem trivial. Anyway, that's my two cents.

If you do you may not have set the tape to the right speed,you have to do it manualy.The one thing that bugs me is when you have the timer program on and you want to use the vcr you have to shut the timer off and when your done turn it on again or your prgrams will not record.

The unit sends out clicks to the receiver once in a while, the transition between scenes is not always smooth,(like a little pause) and while it is still fairly new I can't get any DVD,CD or even a DVD headcleaner to work. All I get is a &quot;incorrect disc&quot; message.

review/text: I love the style of this, but after a couple years, the DVD is giving me problems. It doesn't even work anymore and I use my broken PS2 Now. I wouldn't recommend this, I'm just going to upgrade to a recorder now. I wish it would work but I guess i'm giving up on JVC. I really did like this one... before it stopped working. The dvd player gave me problems probably after a year of having it.

review/summary: One very useful Product for the Video Enthusiast
review/text: This is one of the newest and hottest new combination DVD/VCR combinations on the market today. Upon picking up my purchase of the HR-XVC1U I was impressed. The finish and construction of this product is first rate, and it provides just about every feature one could hope for in a combination unit. Although it does not provide progressive scan for the HD TV owner, for those of us who have a 2 to 3 year old large screen set of 32 - 36 or projection size, it performs admirably. It will play SVHS tapes, and record and play VHS with a clarity I have not seen even on my older SVHS unit. It will also record VHS and show a DVD at the same time. Hook ups and Outputs will impress even the most demanding. The DVD will play all DVD and CD formats. The Remote, it should be noted, is not Universal with the exception of other JVC products, and the Users manual was obviously written by someone with English as a second language. However, if you are able to look past these small limitations, you will not be disappointed. I highly reccomend this product.

review/summary: Perfect for its price!
review/text: I purchased this JVC VHS/DVD combo player after my old VCR pooped out and when I decided I needed a DVD player in my room in addition to the one in our family room. I bought this player when it first came out; VHS/DVD combo players were brand new and seemed much more sensible than separate players. However, I had reservations about this unit, wondering if the quality of the DVD and VHS portions would suffer since both were crammed into one box. My fears were unfounded-- this indeed is a fantastic player!First, I really enjoy the chrome finish; it perfectly matches my silver 24&quot; flat-screen TV. Second, I love the unit's included remote. All of the buttons are solidly formed, and the rew/play/ff/rec/stop/pause buttons glow in the dark for watching movies late at night. Third, the quality of VHS recording is wonderful. I don't know what other reviewers are talking about when they complain of poor quality tape recording; everything I've taped, even on the &quot;EP&quot; (extra-long play) setting, has come out wonderfully. Sometimes, programs taped on certain VCRs look fuzzy on other sets in the house (i.e. if I try to record downstairs with a different VCR and play it back in my room), but anything I tape with this JVC unit is crystal clear on each set in our house. Fourth, I love the different A/V options the JVC unit is capable of utilizing. The JVC unit allows RCA, composite, S-Video, and component cable connections, so use whatever connection works with your TV. I strongly recommend using the component cable hookup as it offers the highest-quality picture. Fifth, I love the functions of the DVD player. Not only does this JVC player offer standard DVD functions like subtitles and markers, it also offers cool functions like zooming. DVDs, CDs, CD-Rs, and VCDs are supported, but SVCDs are not. Sixth, this quality piece of equipment comes at a great price. JVC makes a great unit, and the price is affordable, so don't buy another brand in hopes of getting a better deal.The JVC VHS/DVD player has several A/V options, provides high-quality recording, looks great, comes with a super remote, supports many popular disc formats, and does all of these things for an affordable price. If you're looking for a high-quality, yet modestly-priced piece of equipment to handle your VHS and DVD needs, look no further than this great JVC unit.

review/summary: it's a good quality unit for the money
review/text: Trying to get two audio pieces into one box, offering decent quality, plenty of useful features & low cost may be impossible. I looked at many brands. I needed a unit that has "optical" output for DTS & 5.1 digital to go into my Marantz SR 8000 audio receiver. The cheapest units do not have this, so stay with the better name brands. At this price point I seriously doult that any brand will be very reliable. These units are not being made in Japan, which stood for excellent quality. Instead, China, Tawain, etc. are making them. Making two units into one may save on some costs, but the cost cutting may be the use of cheaper parts inside. So don't expect much from these units.I wanted to replace my older DVD player with one that plays CD-R, CD-RW, and MP3. I purchased the JVC HRXVC1, based on good reviews. JVC is the inventor of VHS vcr, and I have known people to have good luck with their electronics. I also like Panasonic,which makes very reliable electronics. I have had 3 good vcrs with Panasonic, but the clerk said that they were having higher than normal returns on their combo players. Had it not been for that, I would stay with Panasonic.This JVC HRXVC1 vcr/dvd combo has more than enough features needed to play tapes & discs. At this pricepoint it appears to be one of the best featured units I've seen. Hooking it up to my surround receiver was difficult, probably just my fault, although the book isn't clear on the hookup of the "optical" setup with the receiver connections with VCR, etc. Once hooked up, it was worth the effort. The setup was quick and easy. The cds sounded great. The dvd's are crystal clear. The vcr recorded tapes are playing good, and no problems....The GOOD: 1).It works & sounds great. 2.) It looks great on the shelf as well. 3.) There are plenty of features for the money such as Skip Search, index serch, zero return, and three step zoom. 4.) There are front inputs for camcorder or mp3 player to record easy. 5.) This unit has "SQPB" S-VHS Quasi playback which will play S-VHS tapes, and makes for excellent looking viewing of standard tapes. 6.) It has 19um head, for better picture quality in EP mode. 7.) It includes "Spatializer N-2-2" surround for people whose sytems are not setup for surround sound yet. 8.) In use, the rewind & forward is very fast.The BAD: 1.) the remote [is not good]. 2.)the buttons on the box seem unorthodox in their layout. 3.) it's confusing getting around from vcr to dvd, as some buttons have dual use, and buttons are on both sides of the unit. Petty problems, but at least the unit works fine- so far. If it proves to be unreliable, I'll write back.

review/summary: Good DVD Average VCR
review/text: Usually anyone purchasing a combination DVD/VCR player has particular criteria they are meeting in order to get both forms of video into their television. Space, convenience, budget among other reasons comes to mind. That aside, looking at an actual unit the person is most likely more interested about the VCR. DVD reproduction at this level looks so good that it is almost a given fact that it will perform up to someone's expectations. The VCR is another matter. For my own needs I am concerned about the playback of pre-recorded tapes and playback of home VHS recordings that I made. How the DVD/VCR player records in VHS is also important but to a lesser degree. JVC brand VCRs are an interesting and confusing animal when it comes to playback of tapes. I own two JVC S-VHS recorders with flying erase heads. I also own several SONY and older RCA VCRs from the good old days. The problem with JVC is that they play certain tapes back beautifully and others dreadfully. I took several samples of video tape recordings and demonstrated playback on this unit just to see for myself. (I know salesmen at a local electronics store in the area and they always let me try out equipment. They just love low-end technology guys like me.) Pre-recorded movies looked acceptable and I really mean no better than acceptable. Recordings I made on my JVC units in SP and EP modes looked excellent on this unit. Recordings I made on my other SONY units in the SP mode look very good. RCA recordings in SP look average. Recordings I made on my other SONY units in the EP mode looked horrible. They looked like blurred images without any trace of definition. Recordings I made on my other RCA units in LP and EP modes again looked blurred without any trace of definition. However, I made an actual recording on this unit from a satellite broadcast and the playback looked excellent. The bottom line on this unit is that the DVD side looked very good and the VCR performed just about the same as my stand-alone units which I own. There were really no surprises. When I make recordings at home I indicate which VCR the recording was made on just for the very reasons I mentioned above. After many years I have found that a recording usually looks best when played back on the unit it was made from. The reality today is that VHS is an outdated but necessary technology because many of us have a monetary and/or sentimental investment in tape recordings. I think this JVC unit is good but I rate it based upon how I would be using it relative to my library of VHS recordings and how they are going to look.

review/summary: Easy Set Up
review/text: Love this machine! Works great! Set up was easy, although I probably made it harder than it needed to be.I spent some time trying to understand the manual. I finallly just went for it and found setting up the machine was easy.I connected the cable to the dvd player, the color coded cords from the DVD player to the TV &amp; TADA! I was done.I was able to view a VHS tape immediately or switch to a DVD. What's nice about this machine is that I don't have to got through a lot of gyrations to view a DVD or VHS tape. The Sanyo I used to have required all kinds of set up just to view a DVD. (The moon had to be in Aquarious in the seven house and the planets had to be in alignment, just kidding). But seriously, I had to write down the steps for the Sanyo just to remember how to use it. Don't think you'll have that problem with this machine. A happy customer.

review/summary: Great VCR/DVD
review/text: I have to say that this is a great DVD/VCR player. The vcr picture is clear and sharp. I wish that it had VCR+, but instead you have to program the tv shows you want to tape mannually. There should also be an eject button on the remote for the vcr. It's easy to set up, although the user manul is a little confusing, and when you are done setting up what you want to record you have to press the timmer button in order for it to record the shows you want, which is a little annoying. The DVD is great, it also had a clear and sharp picture and works great. I would reccommend buying this JVC combo, because it works great, easy to set up and very little trouble.

review/text: I got this machine primarily for the DVD with MP3 playback. It turns out, that most DVD players with MP3 capability don't allow you to select "random" playing of the tracks!??? I replaced my 12 year-old CD player and my sub-par VCR with this one machine. I'm very happy with it so far, although I wish it had another component input in the back. The DVD playback is awesome. The VCR playback seems fine as well, although since getting TiVo, I don't really use it that much. I recommend this to anyone who wants a versatile player of good quality.

review/summary: Great DVD, mediocre VCR
review/text: This is a fine unit for DVD playback, and has a lot of great features. But my experience with the VCR side left a lot to be desired. The machine has been saddled with a sub-par tuner which makes for noisy, color smeared VHS recordings, and its playback of factory pre-records isn't all that great either (but I will say that EP recordings don't fall off very much quality wise from SP, although the frequency response at both speeds is pretty atrocious). JVC brags about how it's the inventor of VHS. . . shame they couldn't do better here.

review/text: I'm a JVC nut...I have 3 JVC televisions, one VCR, one bookshelf audio system and car audio system. So when it came time to move the VCR player to the boys room and get another one for the old man I knew what make it was going to be. I decided on the combo player because I don't think VHS is going to be around much longer. I like my combo player except for 2 things:(1)no cable box compatability on the remote control (2)no seperate audio video inputs only input for coax cable from my cable box so all of the cable programming is in mono...wife can't tell the difference in the sound so if she's happy then I'll just live with it. VCR and DVD look and sound GREAT!!!!!!!

review/summary: Made me wish I was Einstein.
review/text: Not much I can say about this book... It's full of VVVery difficult number puzzles... at least for me. Okay, so I don't get 'A's for my grades at school, but I think that even you might find it a little difficult. The way I see it, you will need lots of paper, patience and time, say 30 minutes or so to solve even the easiest of these.Why? Because basically, you are asked how many combinations can be formed from such and such. Example: How many ways get 31241 by adding prime numbers only? This is not really what the problems are like in the book, they are far more complicated than that.For me, it's just too much. I can't even do 1 single problem. I can't even look up the answers because uses some sort of a legend that I can't understand. But if you have an above average intelligence or are mathematically gifted, you will probably find some obscure short cut to the problem a la Gauss. For the rest, forget it.Word of warning: these are purely number problems. I can't tell if logic will help or even plays a part in this book, but the problems are NUMBER problems.

review/text: This book appears to be a "print on demand" style book which manifests itself, in this case, as a poor quality hardcover. Some of the text is laughably bad, the few images near the end look like they are snapshots from a black and white TV screen, but most bothersome is the "muddy" look of the text. The price seems a bit steep for such a poor quality print. That said, the actual content is very comprehensive. One of the authors (Gray) is co-creator of the now commonplace LBG (Linde Buzo Gray) VQ algorithm. Fortunately, the quality of the content shines through the terrible printing.

There is, in my opinion, no problem with the printing at all, clear, quality monochromatic printing.With respect to the contents of the book, it has almost everything you may want to know about Vector (and even Scalar) quantization and Signal compression. It was a great help while I was writing my doctoral thesis. Gray is probably one of the most respected authorities in the field.

review/summary: Brilliant Words and Harmony
review/text: A fantastic collection of songs by one of Germany's top songwriters and singers. Similar to Simon and Garfunkel with a bit of Bob Dylan. Haunting melodies and brilliant lyrics.Mey is an impressive talent. This collection of twelve songs include social commentary (Atze Lehman, Zwischen Keiz and Ku'damm, Mein guter alter Balthasar), love songs (both love in bloom -Du bist die Stille (You Are the Stillness)- and love in gloom - Einen Koffer in jeder Hand (A Suitcase in Each Hand) and Es schneit in meinen Gedanken (It's snowing in my thoughts) as well as Mey's trademark humorous songs,The latter include: (1) &quot;Weil Ich ein Meterologe bin&quot; (Because I am a Weatherman) which describes the plight of a weatherman who everyone despises because of his poor forecasts (2) Die Homestory (The Homestory) which describes a celebrity's encounter with journalists ostensibly coming to interview him for an article on how his career began but who over spend their time eating and drinking to the extent that when the article finally appear it describes him as &quot;speechless how it all began&quot; because the journalists have not done their jobs (3) Hab Erdol in Garten (I Have Oil in My Garden) about a homeowner who decides to plant strawberries in his garden and apparently discovers oil. After all the changes this brings (fame, lost friends appearing), he discovers that all he has done is rupture an oil pipeline. (5) Es gibt tage, da wunscht Ich, Ich war mein Hund (There are Days I Wish I were My Dog).If you understand German, you will obviously enjoy this CD more. The CD includes the lyrics (in German) which can be a real help if like me you are not fluent.If you don't speak German, sit back and enjoy the music.

review/summary: Addictive, Posh Fun
review/text: Hotel Babylon is a witty, clever, and utterly addictive 2006 British television series launched in the States via BBC America in 2007. The formula is fool proof: assemble a hotel staff of strongly drawn characters, each with a secret past; add dashes of sexual tension, avarice, silliness and whimsy; then, in each episode fold in a parade of hotel guests, everyone arriving with their own baggage of deceit, pathos, and lunacy. The result is a comedy that has dark dramatic undertones, and a drama that breaks into giggles when the tension reaches a breaking point.The promotional trailers aired on BBCA did not do this justice. Those soundbites made it seem as though the series was a debauched soap opera designed to attract a viewership of self- pleasuring adolescent boys. What a delightful surprise to find such a well-written, well acted series. Serious subjects such as immigration raids and drug trafficking crimelords shift stage with rock stars who refuse to party and sophomoric revenge raids on rival hotels.The action centers around Charlie (Max Beesley), the deputy general manager with a murky past, as he adjusts to his new status in one of London's swankiest hotels. The rest of the staff (many it seems have either shagged him or want to) make his job a challenge, but ultimately pull together to solve the myriad of crises brought on them daily by the guests, who are all played by major stars themselves. (Anthony Stewart Head as the suicidal jingle writer will have you falling off your sofa choking with laughter; Joan Collins as the aging noblewoman will leave you wistful). As the series progresses, the viewer comes to feel sisterly sympathy for the sluttishly obsequious receptionist Anna (Emma Pierson), and certain conspiracy with the barmaster Gino (Martin Marquez). For me? My secret crush has always been Tony the Concierge (Dexter Fletcher), as he knows all, sees, all, can solve all, and is the most centered and upright of them all.You won't regret purchasing this DVD. Each episode is a little treat unto itself (e.g. Episode Six, a homage to Hitchcock, must have been a hoot to film; it's a treasure to watch). You'll enjoy watching and re-watching for time to come.

review/summary: "Guilty Pleasure?"...Nope, Just Good TV
review/text: HOTEL BABYLON has to be one of the most incorrectly-advertised TV shows I've seen. When airing on BBC America this past summer, it appeared to be some glamourized soap opera with sexy women. BBC American salaciously promoted it on "Wicked Wednesdays". These commercials didn't even hint that HOTEL BABYLON was actually a breezy, fast-paced, funny, and surprisingly truthful look at a 5-star London hotel's happenings.Each of the 8 episodes begins and ends with narration by Charlie (Max Beesley), the Deputy Manager of the hotel. Think Augustus Hill from OZ, or the opening quotes from THE WIRE. Charlie's philosophical monologues on the hotel business cleverly bookend each episode. Other characters include:Rebecca (Tamzin Outwaithe) - the workaholic hotel managerTony (Dexter Fletcher from LOCK, STOCK, & TWO SMOKING BARRELS) - a loyal concierge who's mostly the moral center of the showAnna (Emma Pearson) - the superficial receptionist you can't help but put up withThere are other hotel faces that you'll learn along the way, and each is given an appropriate amount of screentime. Cameos don't steal the show, and reoccuring characters are well-balanced throughout the season.What separates HOTEL BABYLON from other tongue-in-cheek comedy-dramas is that although the stories in this show are exaggerated, they all carry a dose of reality. Should there be strange noises and electrical failures during the midnight shift? Probably not, but any hotel employee knows that midnight shifts are as weird as they get. Would rebellious staff members assemble a mock wedding at a guest's request? Highly unlikely, but I've been asked by a guest for stranger favors. Would hotel staff and guests have fraternize, flirt, and have private get-togethers? Well...yeah, I've seen that happen.HOTEL BABYLON treads a very delicate between a variety of genres. There are gut-wrenching laughs and moments that elicit small smirks. The drama can be very serious, but it's never cyncial or mean-spirited. The show is sexy, but not pornographic. The music is sometimes classy, and sometimes deliberately pop.What keeps HOTEL BABYLON captivating, however, is its truthfulness to the world it creates. The acting is very strong, the photography is incredibly stylish (Guy Ritchie - take notes!), the characters are portrayed more with conviction than mockery, the production is top-notch, and the adventures (even the crazy ones) are so well-paced and structured that you just can't help but go along for the ride.People who've worked in a hotel will appreciate the outlandish circumstances this staff can be put in, and how ridiculously dedicated and knowledgable the staff are required to be. And if you've never worked in a hotel before...after HOTEL BABYLON, you'll appreciate the guest services provided and definitely be a better sport on your next vacation. Cheers!Give HOTEL BABYLON a peek. Considering my favorite shows are darker ones like THE WIRE and BATTLESTAR GALACTICA, this BBC gem along with the new DOCTOR WHO is a pleasant surprise.

review/summary: Hotel Babyon - 5 Stars
review/text: I discovered BBC programming after watching the excellent comedy series "Coupling" late one night on PBS. And I must say, the British have some outstanding shows."Hotel Babylon" is easily one of hippest, sexiest shows in recent memory -- miles ahead of NBC's "Las Vegas". Of course much of that can be contributed to the sharp writing and attractive cast, as well as the sleek sets and gorgeous shots of London.Still, there's a lot more to this series than meets the eye. Newly appointed deputy manager Charlie Edwards (Max Beesley) serves as the series' narrator, navigating the trials and tribulations that the staff of the five-star property meet each day.Above Max is Rebecca Mitchell (Tamzin Outhwaite), the Hotel's general manager. She's a gorgeous, confident woman who handles everything from "ordinary guests" to rock stars and even foreign delegates. Though highly poised on the outside, she's hiding a number of secrets that are revealed as the series progresses -- among them the fact that she's left her husband and is currently living inside the hotel itself.The supporting cast is as diverse as it is amusing. Guest concierge Tony Casemore (Dexter Fletcher) does everything from getting theater tickets and restaurant tables, to high-class prostitutes for the rock stars who inevitably arrive from time to time. Joining him at the front desk area is receptionist Anna Thorton-Wilton (Emma Pierson), an old flame of Charle's and a rather superficial social climber."Hotel Babylon" alternates between the day-to-day grind of the hotel business to the persona lives of the characters. All of them seem to have secrets of some kind -- ones that eventually rear their ugly heads on the job. Of course, there's also a good dose of sex, glamor and money, all of which make the series a pleasure to watch!

review/summary: Awesomely Fun!!!
review/text: It took me about an episode and a half to fully be able to appreciate everything this show has to offer. The pacing is very well done. There is not a lot of downtime before character development begins automatically drawing you into the world that the characters inhabit. You immediately know which characters you are going to love and which ones you are going to love to hate. Working in the hotel industry myself in New York City I really enjoy seeing the characters go through the same trials and tribulations of the glitzy and glamorous world of it all if not a little more exaggerated and exciting. I particularly enjoyed the 6th episode with the crazy and eerie overnight shift. All in all I think that after reading the book this is about as perfect a representation of the material as can be made. I recommend the book and the series to anyone that works in a hotel or has ever stayed in a hotel. You will appreciate every episode for at least one of the subplots if not all of them. My only criticism is that the major story arcs that carry over from episode to episode develop a little slowly, but the payoff makes it all worthwhile. One more thing that I really enjoy is the soundtrack. It seems like the entire show is underscored with very nice music to help maintain the mood and create a perfect atmosphere to absorb you into every scene.

review/summary: Great British Show ... Bad Sound
review/text: This is a show about a posh hotel ... and it has enough scandal, sex and drama to satisfy any fan of British television. You'll need a region 2 DVD player to watch this. But those are easy and inexpensive enough to find. One of my favorite shows ever is Footballers Wives and although this show doesn't live up to that benchmark it still sizzles.One caveat is that the sound mixer for this show should be ashamed at themselves. The speaking track is low and muffled in many cases. The music track is booming and loud. It gets annoying because especially for an American viewer, it is hard to understand about a quarter of what is being said anytime there is music playing while characters are speaking. (which is almost always) This is one of the most poorly mixed shows I have ever heard in terms of the audio ... it is almost like someone made this on a laptop. The audio engineer really screwed this up. It makes the show very hard to watch because extremely hard to understand certain characters, especially when things are spoken in hushed tones or whispers. They put music (loungy heavy bass music behind the showe almost always.Beyond the terribly destructive audio, the show is interesting. The characters are ones you can invest in. A witchy manager, a slick assistant manager with a troubled and mysterious past, a lothario bartender, sexy cleaning lady, old school doorman, conniving ex-girlfriend front desk manager and a capable but somewhat shady concierge who steals the show. The guests who check into the hotel pose certain problems ... rockstars, suicidal guests, high class call girls. Each show usually focuses on 2 or 3 of these guests and their problems along with the drama between the staff. It is a good balance of humor and drama and each show is a nice escape where you can get involved in the plotlines and characters without suspending too much disbelief.The resolutions of the episode ... how they wrap up the storyline ... is usually pretty predictable and too cutesy. But this is a small part of the show. I made it through the first season and enjoyed it but to be honest, I don't know how many seasons I could invest myself in watching the same environment. Also, British luxury hotels are a lot different than luxury hotels in the USA. I can't help but think when I watch this how gaudy and cheap the hotel looks. It is supposed to be a creme de la creme top of the line luxury hotel ... however, here in the USA it looks sort of seedy and tawdry and not at all luxurious. Think lots of neon, grey and red. I think the set design does the show a dis-service ... but then again, I've stayed at a few hotels in the British style that were very expensive and very tawdry looking.Overall, a good show with interesting characters and sort of interesting storylines. I don't know how many seasons I could watch this ... but I guess Bad Girls focused on a prison and made it to 7 or 8 seasons. So we will see. Another good British drama with sexy story lines and plenty of plot twists. Anyone who can give me some recommendations on more British soap style dramas like this would be very helpful. I have seen all the Footballers Wives and Bad Girls. I am thinking my next show might be Mile High ... but would love a Brisith tv show in the veign of FBW. This is as close as I've come so far.

review/text: I've watched this before and I come back to it often enough that I felt that owning it was worthwhile - watching it is like having a drink while listening to smooth jazz (if that's your thing) or some really decadent dark chocolate in front of a fire (if that's your thing)...there's something delicious in the way the characters handle all the (sometimes touching, sometimes silly, sometimes suspenseful) situations, so smoothly, handling guests in such a way that they don't know they're being handled. I aspire to deal with office politics and ruffled customers the way the staff of Hotel Babylon do!

review/summary: Fun Series
review/text: I just finished watching the last episode of series 1 of the Hotel Babylon program. For the most part, since there are some serious happenings sometimes, this is a fun series to watch. Lots of funny and naughty things going on.The hotel manager, of the five star Hotel Babylon of London, has husband trouble and you find out why in the last episode of series 1. Her assistant has a dark past, but he seems to be overcoming it well. The concierge is a real sharp character. Front desk staff are very amusing. The bartender (Gino) is a very funny Italian guy. Housekeeping is run by a lady that has more than an eye on the assistant manager. Other staff provide good moments as well too.Guests come in all shapes, sizes and "eccentricities". The guy in drag in the first episode was something else. The honeymoon couple who encounter a rat(supplied by staff) are not to be missed, as are many others as the episodes progress.In the last episode of this series, the assistant manager is shot, but he is still alive at least when the episode comes to an end. Guess viewers will have to see series 2 to see how that works out.This is a British series so be ready for edgy humor at times and some great fun as well. They throw in some serious stuff once in a while for good balance.I am looking forward to series 2. I say give it a try!

review/summary: Good trashy fun...most of the time
review/text: I'm watching this series on Netflix while home sick with bronchitis. For the most part, I've enjoyed it a very great deal. The show provides a glimpse into a fictional five star hotel in London, which is a world that I'll never see behind from the perspective of an insider and probably won't see any time soon as a guest. While some of the capers and scams the staff and guests get up to seem a bit exaggerated for dramatic purposes, a lot of the stories do have some factual basis I'm sure."Hotel Babylon" seems to me to be a sort of combination of the much more inferior (and wholesome) "Love Boat" (with the regular cast being "the crew" interacting with various passengers and their storylines) and the superior British series "Hustle" (about goodhearted British con artists). Stylistically, the series uses a lot of the same tricks that "Hustle" does (sped up action and other visual stunts).The cast is superior and unlike some I actually like the character of Anna (maybe because she's so pretty and has that sexy British upper class accent). The standout characters are Charlie, the super-concierge, and Max, the hotel manager.The plots are fun most of the time with one of the best being when an all star British soccer team visitsThe only major negative I would give the show is when they decide to have a plot that sends a sometimes overwrought political message:1. a preachy episode plot about illegal aliens featuring a heartless immigration inspector2. an episode plot featuring a Bosnian Serb war criminal whose resolution has the cast arguably colluding in a kidnapping and probably murder3. an episode plot that decries child labor in the fashion industryAnother fault is that the characters lie to each other an awful lot and I think that would pretty much erode trust and friendships.But overall, I'd say that if you can suspend disbelief some, it's worth "checking into" Hotel Babylon for a little fun. Just remember "What goes in Hotel Babylon, stays in Hotel Babylon."

review/summary: Is this great TV??? You bet it is
review/text: Hotel Babylon is not just good TV...it's great TV!!!! The show features some incredible acting from Tamzin Outhwaite (formerly of EastEnders, a BBC soap) and Max Beesley (from the ill-fated movie "Glitter" starring Mariah Carey). The show could make for a great drama series, but I felt that it is a mix of a drama, comedy, and soap opera all mixed into a great BBC show. The show aired on BBC America for a while but didn't get around to seeing it. I can now say that I got the DVD set and all the episodes are great. The season finale was an interesting to watch.The show reminds me of Hotel which aired on ABC from 1983 to 1988. The reason...Hotel was set at a fictional San Francisco hotel as Hotel Babylon was set at a luxury five-star hotel in England.I recommend this DVD to anyone who is willing to watch a great show from the BBC.

The coolest thing about this series is that it is something that my fiance and I are heavily addicted to. The drama is quite intense and very entertaining. The one thing that kind of irked me was that Charlie was not as tough or outspoken as I would have liked. He was great with the guests but in regards to the staff and his boss he was a bit too reserved for me. I highly recommend this series and can't wait to see what happens in Season 2

review/summary: Grand Hotel it ain't
review/text: And I thought only Hollywood could produce such self-conscious, unfunny, witless television.Handsome Max Beesley was delightful in Tom Jones, but his career, aside from the big money, has taken a real nose-dive with this series. Likewise, Dexter Fletcher saw much better days with Guy Ritchie. Except for the 'hard-nosed business woman', the women are self-serving bimbos that Las Vegas would be proud of, but all the characters are monochromatic and shameless stereotypes: unctuous Italian, gay black, trampy receptionist. The latter is also a consummate, if failed (due to stupidity), gold-digger who regularly sleeps with any good-looking guest who's rich enough. In fact, the whole place is run like a high-class brothel.These people supposedly work is a 5-star hotel in London, but their every action belies the 'invisible service' that one might expect in such an establishment. Week after week they bully, preach to, invade the privacy of, and otherwise interfere with the lives of high-toned clients. No one ever gets fired, no matter how egregious and selfish their behavior. It can be said that the characters and scripts display all the emotional maturity, and depth, of a ten year old. The episode in which the cliched straight Italian barman affects being gay (taught by the token gay black desk clerk) in order to get a big tip from a gay guest, is both embarrassing and offensive.Other reviewers find this series addictive. I, too, must admit that I watched the whole first series on a popular streaming service, but mostly in order to see if they could maintain such high standards of superficiality and questionable moral tone throughout. They did.At least I didn't suffer the humiliation of paying for it.

If tracks that come from nowhere, do nothing and go nowhere are your thing, stick to T Dream and Edgar's current releases. If you like the opposite and the Dream Mixes groove of electronics, guitars and upbeat tracks then Neptunes is an absolute must. It might sound a bit new agey in places at first, but stick with it and after a few plays you'll be hooked. Track 10 - Murder Mystery Dinner Train - is probably the highlight.

review/summary: Very promising d&eacute;but solo album
review/text: With this 2005 d&eacute;but solo album, "Neptunes", 35-year old Jerome Froese has finally severed the reins and moved away from the familial music-making of Tangerine Dream to strike out on his own. And a very impressive affair it is, too, boding well for the future of his "Guitartronica" project -- blending guitar and MIDI synthesisers and sequencers -- of which this is the first release. Although there remain traces of his TD up-bringing, particularly in the use of wordless female vocal samples and the occasional orchestral string wash, the music here offers both a heavier base and wider range of styles, textures and moods than has been evident in the output of his father's band for a good many years. Jerome's guitar-playing is more versatile and more assured, and his sense of beat finitely more secure than those of Edgar; these combine to make this a very mature album indeed.The whole production (78 minutes spread over 12 tracks) is heavily guitar- and drum-focused and very readily drops into a dance beat but is nevertheless rich and varied in texture and also offers a pleasing shift of mood and in atmosphere as it progresses. It provides many rewards for those who prefer to listen to their music rather than simply to feel (or to move to) it and this album should appeal both to a modern audience as well as to an older generation still bemoaning the disappearance of the 1980s' Tangerine Dream sound world.Highly recommended to anyone looking for something new. (And if you're looking for more like this, try the 2007 follow-up album, "Shiver Me Timbers".)

I echo the sentiments of the other reviewers here in that this album by Jerome far surpasses in quality and originality any recent Tangerine Dream releases.The album is composed of 12 impressive sonic soundscapes (though the last hardly counts as only 40 seconds long). All the tracks have a freshness and lush atmosphere that is quite appealing. its one of those albums that you listen to in entirety rather than selecting a few tracks.

review/text: I'm very happy to have in my hands one of the best CD's of this new Millennium.Back in 2005 when I heard Jerome was going to release his first solo I said: "I don't know. Lets wait and see...". I WAS WRONG.When I got my "Neptunes" CD nobody was at home that day. So, I took a time to relax, drink my orange juice with some drops of bitter almond extract and put my sound system to perform without blowing out any window.Track one. What a beautiful tack!. The best introduction for a great CD.Track two. Great!.Track three. Fantastic!.Track four. Ok, it blown-out my senses. "This track worth the whole CD", I said. But wait, there are more, a lot more.Almost 80 minutes of exquisite music. Tacks 8 and 10 are as good as tracks 4 and 1."Neptunes" reminds me the same feelings I had when I listened "Underwater Sunlight" for the first time back in 1986."Neptunes" music is something like "Mars Polaris" mixed with "DM4" and "DM2: Timesquare".Yes, it is that good.Hats off to Jerome Froese.Eduardo Nava.

review/text: Energetic guitarwork over spacey electronic soundscapes make this the best Tangerine Dream release not by Tangerine Dream!Son of Tangerine Dream founder Edgar Froese the first solo project by Jerome Froese is far better than his father's solo projects.With the exception of the great musical pieces on Tangerine Dream's new Jean D'Arc the instrumental pieces on this album outshine most recent Tangerine Dream releases!Back in the mainstream Gwen Stefani had huge success when she made her solo album without her group No Doubt.Jerome Froese achieves that same level of success here.If you're a Tangerine Dream fan the solo releases of Edgar Froese aren't really essential.Neptunes however is essential to all Tangerine Dream fans.

review/summary: No &quot;Insider&quot; Secrets
review/text: If you are someone who is fairly new to the law school admissions process and haven't done much research on what it takes to get into law school, this information might seem very helpful and insightful to you. However, as someone who has read several other books (Richard Montauk's &quot;How To Get Into the Top Law Schools,&quot; Robert Miller's &quot;Law School Confidential&quot; and more) and done the necessary research on the internet, this book brought very little new information to the table. Perhaps the most unique thing about this book is the &quot;15 essential factors&quot;...unfortunately, many of those 15 factors--though essential--are things the average person applying to law school--particularly top law schools--doesn't care about and might cast aside even after reading this book.I do agree with her that many pre-law advisers are ill-prepared to advise pre-law students and don't know nearly as much as they should. However, if the info in this book is the information she provided other pre-law advisers with, then it's nothing that the advisers nor the students couldn't have come up with themselves or elsewhere. I still say Montauk's book is the best on law school admissions out there, regardless of what schools you're interested in. HIS book is the one with all the insider secrets in it. Wright's book is just a very broad overview of the admissions process, in my opinion.The one thing this book totally has in common with Montauk's book that is very disappointing is that they do nothing to help minorities know what the admissons process will truly be like for them or how to handle it. For that, you have to look up books by Evangeline Mitchell. Most books have a tendency to treat everyone the same, as if all the information applies to them the same, and that is deceiving.In conclusion, if you feel pretty well-informed already about admissions or are looking for an extra bit of information that might give you that edge or illuminate your particular situation...this book is not the one for you. Only if you really know very little about law school admissions might this book be worth it...but I'd still say it'd be best to go with Montauk's eye-opening admissions guide.

review/summary: Not an "ultimate guide"
review/text: Firstly,I enjoyed the format and tone of the book (how the author addressed the reader). However, I did not feel that she imparted any insider secrets that the book promised to reveal. If you are just starting to research law school, and do not know all the requirements of admission, then this book may be a tremendous help. If you have done your homework and are looking for an edge when it comes to admissions, I recommend some more topic-specific books. For example, books on how to write your personal statment, books geared specifically towards LSAT preparation (Powerscore books were the most helpful for me), and there are some websites with great advice geared towards aiding the individuals whom you are asking to write letters of recommendation. Yet, for those new to the entire affair, this book can definitely clarify the requirements for you.

review/summary: Exactly what I needed.
review/text: This book answered all my questions about getting into law school in a plain and straightforward way. It was easy to read, and clear in its explanations. It even answered many questions I hadn't even thought to ask. The stories that are included in its &quot;Tales From the Trenches&quot; are really interesting, sometimes funny, and really help you to know how to avoid mistakes you might otherwise make. It's much more help than any other source I have found. The only thing it doesn't do is have a full LSAT prep course, but it does give you examples of the questions, and tells you how you can structure your own preparation program. Buying this book actually saved me money by helping me choose only to the right law schools for me, and by giving me a way to evaluate LSAT courses.(It turns out that a lot of expensive courses are not as good as you might think!) The appendix alone is worth the cost of the book. It has information on all the law schools sorted by the &quot;15 Essential Factors&quot; for picking law schools as they are outlined in the book. It makes it easier to sort through all the schools to find the right ones to apply to. This book really gave me confidence that I will get into law school. I can't wait to get my &quot;big envelopes&quot;!

review/summary: THIS BOOK SAVED ME OVER $100,000.00!!!
review/text: Boy am I lucky to have found The Ultimate Guide to Law School Admission. I picked it up because a friend recommended it to me as being the best book for the law school application process, and was she right! When I got the book I skipped right to the chapters on the admission process and found the whole thing very informative and encouraging. It let me know that even though I'm not the best student, there are plenty of schools that I would definitly get in to, and it told me how to make my application the best it could possibly be. I am sure that I would have gotten into at least a couple of the schools I had picked to apply to. However, lucky for me, before I sent in my applications I decided to read the book again. This time I started with the first chapter &quot;Should I go to law school.&quot; Guess what? Being a lawyer isn't what I thought it was! I mean, this book told me things about what lawyers personal lives are like, and what their average work day is like... stuff that I had never gotten anywhere else! This chapter convinced me that I would not be happy being a lawyer! Not only did this chapter save me from the expensive application fees... it saved me from spending the next three years wasting my time, and tuition money, pursuing a degree that would have put me in a job that apparently isn't right for me at all! Thank you Mrs. Wright, you saved me $100,000.00! I definitly recommend that EVERYONE read this chapter first! Don't go to law school without it!!!

review/summary: Great treatment of the defeat of reticence by exposure
review/text: Using a quiet, restrained writing style that is a pure pleasure to read, Gurstein chronicles the one-sided battle between the party of exposure and the party of reticence. She is on the side of reticence and writes with the pained nostalgia of a Southerner describing aspects of the War Between the States. Guerstein knows that reticence is a lost cause; she asks only whether it should be.Gurstein makes a quiet case for the reintroduction of taste, judgement, and sensibility into our public lives. This is a common theme these days. What is uncommon is that she derives her &quot;argument&quot; (always presented with the greatest of civility) from the distortion of privacy that somehow led from Brandeis's great legal work on privacy to the transformation of social man to private men and women and eventually to the public dissemination of all sorts of private matters. This is innovative and intriguing.Reticence should emerge from the coordinated behavior of civilized persons; it should not be coerced by legislation and litigation. It is thus especially appropriate that Gurstein never hectors or lectures. Instead, she paints such a delightful alternative portrait of life, far from morning talk radio, nightly real tv, and ever-present commercial messages in nearly all media, that she inspires the reader to aspire toward at least some aspects of reticence.I felt that Gurstein did not define reticence early enough and failed to take advantage of the opportunities to add more detail as the book progressed. I assume that the party of reticence acquired useful knowledge over time, such as after its (happily) failed efforts to prosecute the publisher of Joyce's Ulysses. But these reservations are minor.My most serious concern is whether the domestic party of reticence has foreign (and sometimes not-so-foreign) counterparts in governments that have successfully enforced taste through stern rule of law. I would have appreciated a treatment of these cultural (or anti-cultural) forces. Althoug! h very difficult, such an effort would have greatly sharpened my understanding of the tenets of the party of reticence and its role in our society. Gurstein surely knows that the mere existence of such potential counterparts to her domestic party of reticence may chill further inquiry; after all, she records numerous instances in which the party of exposure has dangled straw men for talismanic protection from true debate. It would be very useful if Gurstein, accounting for the human rights of those oppressed by governmental regimes, could make a better case for the human rights of those increasingly oppressed by the party of exposure, whose methodology of oppression is vastly different. The incremental personal losses to the party of exposure do not lend themselves to the same degree of drama, but possibly, over a sufficiently long period of time, they can present, cumulatively, a meaningful loss of freedom.Henry James wrote that the words, &quot;summer afternoon&quot; were the most pleasant in the English language. Take a summer afternoon (or two) to read this euphonious essay for a refreshing breather from the cacophony of Howard Stern, Don Imus, and their local knock-offs; follow-up news stories on Viagra; Judge Judy; infomercials; network news; and the culture of money, sex, power, and fame hustled by the print and electronic media.

Glorifying God can only be done from a heart that is glad in God. Deep joy in God is the true foundation for all obedience; treasuring Him over all things is the only Christ-exalting motivation to endure suffering...especially to willfuly choose suffering.Show it to your Youth Group, Men's/Women's Group, or Home Bible Study.

review/summary: Requires too much coordination
review/text: I bought this software for my 5 year old. He has a couple of the other RH software games and he likes them a lot. This game, however, was too challenging for him. The biggest problem I see is that the game requires the child to be able to maneuver the vehicle using all 4 scroll keys on the keyboard. During one exercise, which by the way you can't get to the next level until you complete this exercise, the game requires that you use the keys to move while watching out for falling lava rocks and clouds, monitor a fuel gauge, watch arrow indicators that help you determine where objects are in the arena below, and watch a scope that shows animals when you're hovering over the top of them.I tried to perform this exercise myself and got frustrated. It's just too hard to expect even a 7 year old to complete this exercise let alone a 5 year old.There are some exercises he can complete himself but they mostly require using the left, right keys.I don't know who this game would be good for. Parts of it would be too easy for someone 7 or older. Yet some parts are too difficult for those younger than that.

review/summary: You can't pick which parts you want to play!
review/text: I got this for my 4 year old son because he really likes Rescue Heroes and it sounded like it would have some adventures for him.What the description doesn't tell you is that you can't pick which activities you want to play. You have to complete one part before you can go to the next which just doesn't make sense for this age group. There are certain parts he has no interest in or are too challenging so he gets frustrated and can't get to play the parts he does enjoy. The graphics for the different rescues are very basic and each time you go through the sequence it's exactly the same stuff, so even if he could do it I think it would get boring fast. The only reason I gave this 2 stars instead of 1 is that my son has enjoyed watching it (while I play it). If you're looking for something your child can do easily by themselves without getting frustated - don't get it. Almost all of the play involves using the arrow keys instead of the mouse. If your child has no problem with the arrow keys, he might not have trouble.

review/summary: Very Frustrating
review/text: My three year old son was very excited to get this but after two attempts at playing it hasn't been touched since. You are not able to use the mouse through any of the games except for the "power-up segments" instead you are using the up-down arrows on the keyboard - too hard for him and not much fun. Very disapointed with this game and wish I could return it.

review/summary: Lava Landslide
review/text: I gave this game to my son as an early birthday present. He's almost four and loves the Rescue Heroes. The reviews I read were mixed so I decided to buy it anyway. I'm really glad I did. Sure it's challenging, but it's a good excuse for the parents to get involved. First I did the hard parts for him, to show him what needed to be done. Then I guided him through them and finally he ended up doing it all by himself. He was so proud when he accomplished the hard tasks that he couldn't do at first!Unlike most computer games this one requires the use of the arrow keys instead of the mouse. Well, it's always nice to learn new skills.I can't wait to give my son the two other RH games I baught for his birthday. I have no doubt he'll love them too.

review/summary: A must read for anyone with blood pressure issues
review/text: Books by Dr Kenneth Cooper have been a tremendous source of guidance for me for over 30 years.When I first started being affected by the stress side effects of working too hard and too long in the 70's I started exercising. At the time jogging/running was becoming quite popular, so I took that up. I like to read so I read the Jim Fixx book on running which led me to Dr Cooper's book "Aerobics" (a term he coined), then to "Aerobics Program for total Well Being...", which became sort of a bible for a long time. After retirement I quit smoking and started going to a doctor. Found to be out of shape - again - I looked up Dr Cooper and saw his book "Start Strong, Finish Strong" which I absorbed like a sponge dropped in a bucket of water. Joined a gym and started the prescription of 55% aerobics, 45% strength and have never felt better. Now I've got one doctor trying to tie me down to hypertension drugs. That diagnosis was contrary to my own readings, so I'm in the middle of a complete cardio workup. (The initial stress test results were great, waiting for the in depth analysis.) When I saw this book it was a gotta have.In this book Dr. Cooper very thoughtfully presents all factors in a very helpful manner with a goal of controlling blood pressure without medications, but points out factors that could make them necessary. After my first reading I feel like I can more intelligently discuss the stress test results with my cardiologist, then better deal with my general physician.I would hardily, strongly recommend this book for any person who has had a too high blood pressure reading.

review/summary: Real Alaskan Sourdough
review/text: Ruth Allman has written an excellent book about Alaskan sourdough history and provided very tasty receipes. As a resident of Kodiak,Alaska I have been lucky enough to get some of Ruth Allmans sourdough starter. I have tried her receipes and all I can say is , wow! San Francisco look out. You get a real sense of the struggle of the pioneers with this book, and the way she describs the receipes, you can just imagine spreading the butter and jam on the bread. My favorite receipe is the hot griddle cakes with fresh strawberries. As Ruth says, the art of mixing the batter with air, and the timing of slopping it on the grill is a skill learned over time. The Baked Alaska with sourdough waffles (which by the way is how it was actually first made) is a dessert from heaven. This is a book that every sourdough making Alaskan owns.

review/summary: Cheechako to Sourdough in 190 Pages
review/text: My poor dogeared, stained copy of this book came to me by way of my dad and brother after their trip to Alaska in 1989. Dad acquired some starter in about 1959 that its guardian said had been going since the days of the 49ers. I know it's been bubbling since then. All Dad made, though, were bread and rubbery pancakes. He, unfortunately, didn't buy a copy for himself, although I'd give anything to have him make another meal of them! You see, that's the magic of sourdough, the romance, the stories, the memories! I've not yet been to Alaska, but Ruth Allman has taken me from Cheechako to Sourdough by generously sharing her recipes and her stories with me. I read this book just for the enjoyment of it sometimes. We had her waffles this morning. I made her Flower Rolls recipe into Danish rolls for my famously fussy father-in-law. What better tribute could I make to this cook and her book than to say that he loved them! My two year old son and I will make a little fire in the woods and bake a sourdough version of bannock in Dad's old Dutch oven this week and make some memories of our own.

It was bubbling away the next morning and I can't wait to try it in a few more days...The directions in this book are simple to follow. The anecdotes and history provided are entertaining. The recipes all sound delicious! I'll be working my way through many of these, starting of course with the sourdough hotcakes and bread. The handwritten format just adds to the charm of the book.

review/summary: Cannot recommend
review/text: As a former Alaskan, I didn't want to have to do this. But after repeatedly attempting Allman's recipes and having to throw out 8-10 cups of flour and miscellaneous ingredients nearly every time--and then comparing to Ed Wood's recipes which work flawlessly, and Lisa Rayner's very excellent Wild Bread: Hand-baked sourdough artisan breads in your own kitchen, I can't help but notice that their recipes work, where Allman's fail.I'm not a novice baker. The only thing that worked reliably was the pancakes recipe, but that can be found other places as well.If you are looking for reliable recipes and concise information about starting a sourdough and maintaining it, I recommend any of Ed Wood's books, even his very old ones. Lisa Rayner has written a fabulous tome in Wild Bread. But pass on this book.While some of the historical vignettes were interesting--not enough so to warrant the cost of the book. Check it out at your library if you must.

review/summary: The best sourdough book around
review/text: For those of us who would prefer to use sourdough starter as the sole leavening agent in making breads, this cookbook is very helpful in getting us "started". There are some receipts calling for the addition of yeast, and baking soda is often added not so much to leaven loaves as to create a chemical change which dampens some of the sourness in a very sour pot of starter. Overall, this book gives some of the best history of sourdough from a lady who knows first-hand the importance of an active sourdough starter, and will get any beginner started off making some very good breads, rolls, breakfast items & desserts. There is even a section at the end for making various products from the wild berries grown in the Last Frontier (for those of us who are able to utilize lingonberries & such)! Even for those who don't care to do a lot of baking, this book has a great deal of interesting information about Alaska & its pioneers - a great read for celebrating our 50th year of Statehood!

review/summary: A Bit of Heaven
review/text: I got this book because of all the interesting stories and sourdough tidbits that it contained. The stories were informative, a fascinating look at history, and most of all - FUN! Then, because she made it sound so easy and delectable - I decided to try making sourdough and see what would happen. I had to go back and forth in the book a little to make sure I was doing everything correctly - the Sourdough Hints in the back were very helpful. Well, it's been a week since I mixed up the starter. The sourdough smelled "sour cream sour" and it looked OK. (I was glad not to see little black fungus or other such nasties growing on the surface like the last sourdough I tried to make 20 years ago). So I made the Quick Sourdough Bread today. I figured that was a good place to start since I didn't want to take time for the 2 risings that the regular Sourdough Bread recipe called for. It rose nicely in the pan. It smelled good. But I did take it out of the oven 10 minutes early, because it was a deep golden brown and I was afraid it would be a rock-hard loaf if I waited the full 45 minutes. I brushed butter on the crust to soften it a little (still paranoid about the possible hard crust) and waited for it to cool. I sliced it. My husband and I had one slice. Then we had another. (And, yes, then we had one more with black cherry jam!) Oh My Goodness!! I haven't had bread that tasted that good in a LONG time!! My husband put it this way, "It is a slice of Heaven!". I agreed wholeheartedly - better than candy, cake or cookies! So take it from a person who has hundreds of cook books and probably thousands of recipes and has cooked all sorts of bread for the last 30+ years - this book is worth getting. It made the best bread we have ever eaten and now I can't wait to try some of the other recipes in the book. Four thumbs up.

review/summary: Imprecise Recipes Make Bad Bread
review/text: It's quaint, I'll give it that. The handwritten style and illustrations are reminiscent of, perhaps, an early scratch draft of "The Moosewood" done with a sharpie instead of a nib and ink. But the recipes for bread are poorly assembled.Any bread maker knows how the proportionality of ingredients is key for bread. I've tried two of the four bread recipes so far and neither have performed well. One recipe calls for 8 to 10 cups of flour, which I halved, and so attempted 4 to 5 cups. At 3 cups, my dough was full. Okay, yes, great variety of atmospheres and starter consistency, yes, but the next recipe was like that too. And my sponge has not raised a mm in 24 hours. Perhaps it's too cold in my kitchen? Nevertheless, don't expect this book to even hint at how long a rise will take.And what kind of sourdough calls for baking soda or commercial yeast? The kinds in this book!I'm not claiming to be an expert on bread, but I've made two loaves a week for 2 years now, with a lot of success with other cookbooks (America's Bread Book, The Bread Book, My Bread); I think this one is lame. I'm glad it's my housemate's and that I didn't pay for it.

review/text: Bought this in 1982 and used it thoroughly for years until it fell apart and was held together with rubber bands, paper clips, and clothes pins...then it got away. This book is as much fun just to read as it is to cook from. Full of Alaskan lore, great recipes, and if you are into sourdough, or think you might be, this may be the only recipe book you'll ever need for just plain family eating: breads, biscuits, hot cakes, waffles, and anecdotes.

review/summary: Enjoyed Ruth's Sourdough pancakes when she served them.
review/text: I toured the House of Wickersham in Juneau Alaska years ago. After the tour, Ruth Allman served everyone Sourdough pancakes with her Rose Hip syrup. After such a delicious treat, I bought a copy of her book. I have a 1976 first edition. It has had a lot of use and that use is showing. In a few years, I will have to get another, later edition of this book.It is the best sourdough cooking book I have, and the stories she tells of "Life on the Last Frontier" only add to the book. Her father, Judge Wickersham, was one of the first territorial judges and first territorial governors of Alaska, having served in these positions shortly after President Lincoln purchased Alaska from Russia. Ruth weaves stories her father told her, throughout her book. Ruth and her husband Jack Allman, lived many years as Alaska Pioneers, and had to survive on their sourdough pot. From those days comes many of Ruth's receipes.My only regret is that I did not have Ruth Allman autograph my copy.

review/summary: The Best Sourdough Starter for Bread & Hot Cakes
review/text: I had an excellent sourdough starter from a friend in Alaska. Debbie lived on the 49 Mile River. During the winter they, Debbie & Brad made bent wood furinture to sell in a general store in Dawson. Then pan for gold in the summer. Sourdough bread & hot cakes was a staple of life for them living in such a remote location.Ruth Allman's, "Alaska Sourdough" cook book is an excellent primer in making a sourdough "starter" from scratch,(just in case you can't get a start from a friend) the proper care for your starter, and how to rejuveniate the starter when needed. We are very selective who we share our sourdough bread & rolls with. We don't want to be depended upon to provide bakery items all the time.We made our purchase from redtree15 on Amazon Marketplace. We really appreciate the service provided.

review/summary: Not your quick refrence cookbook
review/text: After having a chance to read through the book I am not sure I would have bothered purchasing it in a store. The "sourdough lore" is very interesting but in order to make the book seem more "authentically old" the author has hand-written each and every page. That's right, the only thing typed in this book is the copyright info. Her handwriting is more or less legible but it's much more difficult to read at a glance and the frequent misspellings bother me. The instructions also assume that you already know how to do a lot of things. For example, on the recipe for doughnuts it says to mix the ingredients, allow to rise, and the deep fry the cut doughnuts. I have to cut doughnuts? Is there anything I do to them first? I don't know, because none of that is included in the recipe. Also, there is no master index.Finally, all the recipes I have gone through are scaled to make massive portions. There is no eating for two out of this cookbook and you can't cut them down because they call for an odd number of eggs. Example - the pancake recipe will make about 15-20 medium sized pancakes (and calls for two cups of sourdough starter - not workable for people who don't have huge batches of starter) yet calls for only 1 egg.UPDATE: After working with this cookbook more, I wish I could have given it a lower review. It's not really a cookbook as there are probably only about 5 unique recipes. Everything else is a VARIATION that she calls a new recipe. And some of her suggestions are just plain gross. Corned beef and Worcestershire pancakes? Cottage cheese and smoked fish pancake roll ups? Ick! There are about 10,000 things she recommends doing with waffles but these are not unique recipes - these are tips, hints, and VARIATIONS. Cover waffles with ice cream, meringue, pancakes, ham, make them a sandwich, cook them with curry and dip them in fish paste. YUCKO!

There are so many great stories that even without the recipes it would be a great book. I love the muffins, they don't taste like sourdough at all! I will say that if you don't know how to bake bread you should get another book along with it. I would recommend "Beard on Bread." Don't trust him for sourdough, he dose not like it. His recipe for sourdough calls for milk with Ruth Allman says causes spoilage.

review/summary: Sourdough...Alaska style
review/text: Frankly, "Alaska Sourdough" will not suit everyone's tastes. Don't get me wrong, "Alaska Sourdough" is as much interesting from an historical standpoint as it is for the unique recipes derived from "on the trail" sourdoughs who purportedly derived these concoctions over many, many years of preserving their stock of sourdough. One gets the feeling that sourdough was the lifeblood--the sustaining force--that kept many of Alaska's intrepid miners and inevitable shysters alive when all other earthly endeavors and pleasures had evaporated.The unique uses for sourdough (makes a wonderful glue, did you know?) keeps the book moving forward, and the recipes can be a bit bizarre, especially the numerous uses of mixing clams in pancake and muffin recipes. If you're looking for more practical recipes, Ruth Allman includes those as well in what appears to be a handwritten book, simulating the feel of recipes jotted down on note cards or loose pieces of paper. The section on waffles and pancakes I found to be very useful; however, the section on creating basic sourdough bread seemed to be laborious compared to the many no-knead methods other sourdough experts espouse. A good sourdough starter is its own leavening agent, creating a dough that will rise on its own. Allman's recipes frequently encourage the use of baking soda, baking powder, and even commercial yeast to speed up the respective recipe processes. This concept might not set too well with traditional sourdough bakers."Alaska Sourdough" does not take too long to peruse. After doing so, I did a little research on Ruth Allman and her husband and found their influence to be substantial in the Juneau, Alaska community in the early 20th Century. I would encourage anyone who found the historical aspect of "Alaska Sourdough" to be compelling to look into the House of Wickersham and Ruth Allman's interesting involvement in its development and perpetuation.

Now, if I can just figure out the quirks of baking and keeping a good sourdough "growing" on my salmon troller...If you love great sourdough, give this a try...

review/summary: A "Treasury" is the Right Word.
review/text: I was happy to discover that these recordings have just been re-released, because my old vinyl copy of the theater songs has seen better days. I was very pleased to see that this re-issue now includes transliterated lyrics and English translations, which were missing from the version I had, and which are a tremendous help to language students. (I was sorry to see they had omitted "Got Fun Avrohom" from the collection, though, because it's one I've always loved -- but I still have it on the vinyl.)I agree this collection is a treasury, both in the sense that these beloved songs are treasures, but also in the sense that they are preserved here now and protected for posterity. Many nearsighted people don't care that the Yiddish culture that once thrived in Eastern Europe before the war is on the brink of disappearing forever.With only a few Yiddish-speaking enclaves left now, in cities like Winnipeg, Montreal, and New York City, the vibrant cultural heritage that these songs embody may become extinct within our lifetimes, or perhaps those of our children. And the world will be much the poorer.

review/summary: Robert Kane's *The Oxford Handbook on Free Will*
review/text: Do you want to brought up to speed on the state of the art in philosophical discussions of free will? Do you want to give yourself a top-flight graduate course on this exciting philosophical topic? Then read Robert Kane's The Oxford Handbook on Free Will. This book might be the single best book to study if one wants a comprehensive overview of most of the controversies unfolding in debates about free will and moral responsibility. The essays are all outstanding. Each is penned by one of the leading figures in the field, and each combines an effort to teach at a very advanced level with a novel contribution to the literature pitched from the perspective of the author. For example, in the section devoted to compatibilism (the view that free will and moral responsibility are compatible with determinism), Kane includes four essays, one by Bernard Berofsky, another by Ishtiyaque Haji, a third by Paul Russell, and a forth by Daniel Dennett and Christopher Taylor. Each essay is detailed, crisp, completely informed, and clear as a bell. Each also advances the author's own views. Reading through this section, one can learn exactly what is now taking place in the arena of compatibilism. The same can be said about the section devoted to libertarianism (the thesis that some persons act from a sort of free will that requires the falsity of determinism). In this section, Kane includes probably the four finest philosophers currently defending this topic, Tim O'Connor, Randy Clarke, Carl Ginet, and Kane himself.In all, there are eight sections to Kane's collection with a total of 25 essays. The sections are devoted to the following topics: 1) theological issues as they pertain to free will, 2) theories of physics and the free will problem, 3) the consequence argument (a highly influential argument for the thesis that determinism is incompatible with the ability to do otherwise), 4) compatibilism, 5) the relevance of alternative possibilities for moral responsibility (some philosophers think that the freedom to act otherwise is not required for moral responsibility), 6) libertarian views, 7) non-standard views about the relationship between free will, moral responsibility and determinism (such as the view that no one has free will or moral responsibility regardless of the truth or falsity of determinism), and finally, 8) neuroscientific influences on our understanding of the free will topic. An impressive range of topics indeed.I have been publishing and writing on the topics of free will and moral responsibility for over 10 years now and I simply know of no single collection that even approximates the impressive quality and breadth of Kane's handbook. It is an outstanding book.

review/summary: Oxford and Kane have done it again!
review/text: So far forth, the editors of the Oxford Handbook series have managed to put together products which both the neophyte and the fully-informed scholar will find beneficial. Robert Kane has certainly done his part to keep up the trend.All of the essays in this volume are written by philosophers who have made significant individual contributions to the contemporary discussion about human freedom. Most of the authors have also produced influential works in related fields (philosophy of mind, action theory and moral psychology), and many of them are thoroughly conversant with the relevant empirical research in physics and neuroscience. Indeed, parts II and VIII of the book are dedicated, respectively, to the interplay between the problems of free will and quantum physics/chaos theory on the one hand, and recent work in neuroscience on the other. The result is a compilation of essays written with the sort of texture and philosophical sensitivity that repays careful (re-)reading, and brimming with suggestive ideas that could well move the debate into some relatively unexplored terrain. (We should expect nothing less from a volume edited by Kane, who has himself long advocated the importance of approaching the ancient problem of free will from novel directions.) What's more, the collection includes essays from several philosophers whose own books on free will are, though quite important and valuable, somewhat cost prohibitive. (Anyone living on a graduate student's salary who's tried to pick up a copy of Pereboom's or Clarke's or Double's or Strawson's books will know what I mean.) So the expense of the present volume is, when seen in that light, thoroughly justifiable. In fact it's a steal! Or so I've tried to convince my wife.Finally, with his characteristic combination of clarity and rigor, Kane provides a lengthy introduction to the book that will help both the professional philosopher and the new-comer find their bearings in this complex debate with as little intellectual turmoil as can reasonably be hoped for. The book is a good one, highly recommended.

review/summary: Kane's Compilation Will Leave You Proud To Lose An Argument
review/text: I first encountered Bob Kane's skill with the daedal discipline of free will in his book *The Significance of Free Will.* At that time, I realized that Kane had an almost suspicious talent for articulating my own objections, and then articulating a response that would often satisfy me more than my own.While such a talent may be a bit threatening for readers aiming to claim their own victories, Kane's affability and enthusiasm always leave the reader not only with the necessary knowledge, but with a sense of pride in having participated in his well-authenticated jaunts.This work, in particular, highlights Kane's skills as both an original author and an editor with an honest eye for the best arguments of his opponents. It will certainly become a staple, if it has not already, for professional scholars of free will and curious by-standers alike. The *Oxford Handbook of Free Will* draws together balanced selections from the most relevant authors in the field, and-despite its depth-manages to cover a range broad enough that the book would be equally well placed on the shelves of theologians, philosophers, and physicians.My main criticism is that the compilation elides some selections that, to me, seem indispensable. Then again, such a problem *should* be inevitable for a field as factious as free will, and is blunted by Kane's need to balance his equations.The Oxford group has again demonstrated their wisdom in selecting Kane as the editor of this volume. Compared to its competitors in the prosy pantheon of free-will texts, this selection will leave you energized to gnaw through the next puzzle (rather than feeling deflated by the fact that there remain more arguments to be broached).-Christian P. Erickson, M.D.christianerickson@alumni.duke.edu

review/summary: Good TV for the price - MORONIC remote
review/text: I purchased my 6620LDG, like other reviewers, to replace my old kitchen TV. I really wanted an LCD with a built-in DVD player. While I like the TV just fine, the remote is another story. I actually wrote to the manufacturer about the remote and gave them quite an earful. Included in my e.mail was the following:"While I find the overall TV to be good, I am appalled at thequality and functionality of the remote that operates and comes withthat particular model. I simply can't believe that a name brand likeSylvania would provide such a poorly designed remote to accompany ahigher-end TV.""...this remote is very uncomfortableto hold and operate. It is as if your designers made no accommodationsfor how people hold remotes, and what makes them comfortable.""Seriously. I cantt imagine who designed the actual size and shape of that remote or which idiot approved it's public distribution, but the entire lot of them need to find other professions if they think that this remote is at all acceptable.""A remote should be, at the very least,functional and comfortable enough to go unnoticed, dont you think???? Aside from the horrid shape, size and weight of the remote, this remote has an absolutely terrible layout and lacks some of the most basic buttons that come with the cheapest of remotes. I was shocked and horrified to realize that this hideous remote had no "last channel" button. Are your designers living in the 70s or do they just have their heads up their butts?""I havent had a TV remote in my hand without a last channel button in at LEAST 20 years. Since the remote is so huge, how could it not have one of the most traditional buttons on it? I consider the very lowest and feature-less remotes to be those in hotel rooms. They look like top-of-the-line models when compared to this piece of crap.On top of not having the basic buttons, and amongst other issues, the remote is frustrating because: 1. The text is illegible, 2. The buttons are laid out in a way that doesnt make sense and 3. When you channel surf, the remote is so slow to change the channel that you want to throw it on the floor and stomp on it. In fact, if I can find a universal remote that works with this TV; I intend to do just that. Of course, to add insult to injury, it states clearly in your owners manual that 'We do not recommend the use ofuniversal remote controls. Not all of the functions may be controlledwith a universal remote control.' Great, so you provide a bottom of thebarrel remote with your TV, but then dont allow your customers to get adecent remote by making your TV uncooperative with them. This is thefirst time that I have encountered this too, BTW."Finally:"I hope that you promptly change the remote that comes with the 6620LDG LCD TV/DVD combo TV. I expect that you will experience many returns of this product due to the crappy remote that comes with it."THIS was their entire response:"Thank you for taking the time to express your concerns regarding our product. Your comments and opinions are important to us. Please understand that it is our objective to provide the best possible product. We hope you accept our apologies for the inconvenience you have experienced with our product."I am on the verge of taking this back because of the remote.

review/text: I compared a few different flat panels with review before I narrowed down my pick, which ended up with the Sylvania as over well liked. The picture got great reviews which yes it does have a good picture to look at but there are other important qualities you enjoy that makes viewing tv all the better. For example: sound... how was that forgotten?In this flat panel, it was. What a disappointment. If this is consider stereo than why does it sound like its coming from a tin can with no base at all. Then too boot, if you play the dvd, the sound drops and you have to really turn up the volume to hear.I want the whole package deal: space saving, great picture, and good sound. I want to enjoy the whole experience of watching and listening. How about you?

They gave me an RMA number right away, Fedex picked it up the next day and a new one arrived 1 week later. This one is just fine. I really love the clarity of the picture. My only complaint is that in DVD mode, the sound isn't loud enough. I have it in my RV and with the A/C running, I can barely hear it. I solved the problem by running an audio out jack from the TV to the input on the RV stereo speaker system. It's very lightweight and easy to move around and store. A bonus for the RV. The remote isn't great, but it works just fine and the video/audio jacks and antenna input are easy to get to as is the DVD player. All in all, it's a great deal for the price.

review/summary: A great comeback effort
review/text: This was Red's comeback album after being off the jazz scene for over a dozen years, thanks mainly to a severe drug addiction, though other health problems contributed (bad teeth and a stroke in 1972). His chops were not back yet and he knew it, and it shows to a certain extent on this CD. But there is also some great stuff here.For one thing he is not afraid to be ambitious and except for his frequent employment of the mute (which I think he uses to hide the fact that his open tone, which later became as ringing and bell-like as it had been in the '50s, wasn't back yet), he is on the attack. Tempos are up and his playing fiery. This is especially true on DONNA LEE and 52nd STREET THEME, classic bop tunes that demand precision and energy. Alto sax man Charles McPherson is a good foil for Red and plays well throughout. The rhythm section is solid and probably the steadiest player on the date is pianist Barry Harris: he is the perfect anchor for the date. Considering the circumstances, especially the effects from the stroke the year before, Red overcomes the adversity and had every right to be proud of this album. Hopefully, he was.

Rick's books are excellent for more in-depth visits, but this is great for first-timers trying to figure it all out.

review/summary: Europe Eyewitness Travel Guide by Dan Colwell
review/text: This book was an excellent buy. I recently had a holiday in Europe and it never left my side. It is packed with information, pictures and maps and in fact people travelling with me kept borrowing it all the time and were going to buy it when they got home because it had all the information they wanted to show family and friends as to where they had been and what they had seen. Highly recommended.

review/summary: Disappointed Romanian!
review/text: This book in my opinion is biased and takes an angle of Europe that is "clean and proper" and fails to shed light on the rest of it. I can understand that these are "tourist guides" and why would anyone want to tour a country forgotten by time. However, I am a very disappointed Romanian with this book and would never use it as my reference. I have seen travel guides outlining Europe exclude Romania before, but with the precision and detail of DK's series, I was left yet again in disappointment.

review/summary: The Travelers Companion
review/text: I admit it: I'm addicted to travel. My wife and I are semi-retired and we are on the go half the year. We travel for our home-based business, "The Nurses Choice" which cover 50 metro areas and therefore must visit a variety of cities. We then decided to expand overseas.Having to plan for a trip to Europe, we searched for a guide that would provide what we needed. The "Eyewitness Travel Guides" offered a total package. Good maps, photos, recommended places to see, dine, and stay. It's well-organized and relatively small. We brought it on the tours of France and Italy. It served us well, allowing us to find and decide what to see fairly readily. A friend just borrowed it and they said the same thing. It really aided their decisions and provided a reliable course of action. We plan to buy the other series for other locations. That should speak for itself.

review/text: The Dk Travel guides are the best travel guides produced, each one a high quality illustrated encyclopedia on the country or city it represents. They are invaluable guides. The only disadvantage is that they are a bit on the heavy side, but the quality of printing and extensive range of color photos offsets that.

review/summary: A Superlative Planning Aide and Top-level Guide
review/text: This book was tailor made for our trip, which was for 3 weeks, hitting 8 major cities. It was useful for planning as well as a take-along guide. We traveled by train, and the book was great for "getting our heads in the game" for the next stop. The pictures are rich with detail, including cut-away views of many historical structures like castles and cathedrals. The historical synoptic narratives are extremely well written, delivering maximum information in the space available. The quality of the paper is impeccable, with a glossy finish and gorgeous colors.My 13-year old daughter, unexpectedly and unprompted, devoured the book during the train rides. She set aside her DVD player and forty or so movies, and focused on the book - day, after day, after day. She never watched a movie on the trains. When she finished studying the section on our next city, she moved outward in the book to other features of the country. She would go back and forth between the various city descriptions, the country maps, and the map of Europe. We would go into museums, and she would point out pictures she had seen in the book. Eventually, she had carefully looked over every page of the book and read far more than just what was relevant to our destinations. She probably reread the section on Anne Frank 10 times, even though we didn't get to Amsterdam and she has already read two books on the subject. Tomorrow morning, a Saturday with me off work, she and I are going to sit down together and go through the book, tabbing the sections that cover places we went. At the expense of sounding schmaltzy, I expect it will be a sentimental keepsake for the rest of her life.This is a great book for early planning, especially if you haven't decided on which cities to visit. On the other hand, if you've already made up your mind and you are visiting fewer than four cities, this is probably not the book for you - you wouldn't buy an encyclopedia if you only wanted to read three articles. Buying the book early can give you time to buy a more focused book for cities where you find you need more information.The binding on the book will appear somewhat unusual if you're unfamiliar with this publisher as I was. Sitting on a bookshelf, it looks like a hardbound book in a colorful dust jacket, even though there is no removable jacket at all. In fact, it is sort of a hybrid between a paperback and a hardbound book. The cover is actually vinyl: solid but flexible and looks and feels almost like it is plastic coated. The cover extends above and below the pages like a hard cover. One negative is that it is fairly heavy for a relatively small book. This is because of the 800, full-color, glossy pages in a book that is less than 1.25 inches thick. The other dimensions are roughly 8.5 X 5.25.I'm sorry, but I've got to take a shot at some of the negative reviews. Some criticized a lack of depth. What do you expect with 20 countries covered in 800 pages and content split between pictures, historical narrative, and touring advice that gets all the way down to restaurants and shopping? This book is a careful compromise between breadth and depth. (Our next trip will be to only three cities, and we'll buy more focused books then.) Frankly, I don't see how the publishers could have crammed more information into such a compact space. To the fellow who said the only Eastern European country covered was Czechoslovakia: (1) it's the Czech Republic, and (2) are Hungary and Poland not part of Eastern Europe? To the person who said the maps were not useful, I have to point out that maps that can actually help navigation typically can't fit on pages this small. What do you want, 200 foldout maps in an 800 page book?BTW, we brought along a set of maps that we had bought online. Surprisingly to us, we ended up mostly relying on the free ones available in the three, four, and five star hotels we stayed in. We never failed to get a good map from a hotel front desk or concierge. Even after all the preliminary study (also, my wife and I had been to most of the cities before), we often asked for suggestions on sites and several times made some new discoveries that way. We brought along a Garmin GPS, but used it very little because we were on foot, and the Garmin instructions used street names while the streets were often unmarked. (Try looking on the sides of buildings for street names.)Bottom Line: You are investing a significant amount of money, time, and sweat equity in your trip. While it isn't cheap as books go, in the greater context of trip expenses, this book is practically free. Probably the most significant cost is the weight allowance it eats up. (Put it in your carry-on; the airlines haven't started weighing those yet.) In the uses that I've described, it can significantly enhance your experience. When you get back, it will look good on your bookshelf. If you are still deciding on which cities to go to, or if you are going to more than a few cities, buy this book. You'll thank yourself, again and again, just as I thanked my wife.Bon voyage ..... buon viaggio ..... ibuen viaje ..... and, lest we forget, ..... gute fahrt!

review/summary: Good Overall Idea
review/text: I really like the eyewitness guides, I have seven including "Europe". All of them have tons of images, walking routes throught various cities, contact information for sites, hotel listings, resturants, and in many cases floor plans of museums and other buildings. I also like the fact that they give some history of the country, show images of the currancy, list suggested times to visit very busy sites and show some of the reasons why you would select to visit particular attractions.True this book does not cover all of Europe, but it does have sections on the more "popular" travel destinations. It is good if you want some general information on many different countries and to help determine which you have interest in visiting. It is not to large to carry around and has extended cover flaps to help mark the section.The last thing is that if you are traveling to only one country or going to spend a most of your time in one city, look for the individual eyewitness guides. The information in the Ireland book was better for the two week visit to Ireland, where this book (the Europe book) would have been only ok for that trip, but was perfect for the three days in Edinburgh and helping to select which countries to visit when we only had time for a few days in each.

review/summary: nice eye candy, but not as handy as the other guides
review/text: The Eyewitness Travel Guides in general provide lots of pretty pictures and are very nice, but if you want a handy, practical guide to TAKE WITH YOU on a trip you are much better off with the Rick Steves, Lonely Planet, Fodor's, or Frommer's series of travel guides. The other guides provide much better info on logistics like where to stay, where to eat, and transportation. Eyewitness (DK Publishing) makes great coffee table books, and that is what this book is. I recommend Rick Steves Best of Europe, or Lonely Planet's Europe on a Shoestring if you want a more useful guide.

review/summary: Colourful Digest Of Places To See In Europe
review/text: I bought this book to help me plan my trip to Europe and it was so useful, it was the only book I packed to take on my trip. The book covers mainly Western Europe along with Poland, Czech Republic, Hungry, and Greece. The former Soviet Union, former Yugoslavia, Albania, Bulgaria, Romania, and Slovakia are not covered and neither are the islands of Iceland, Malta, and Cyprus. Similarly, of the "tiny" countries, only Monaco and the Vatican are mentioned; Liechtenstein, Andorra, and San Marino are not.The book describes what is available to see in Europe. For each country, about six to twenty cities/regions are discussed and for major cities (e.g. London, Paris, Amsterdam, Venice, etc.) there is more detailed coverage, such as six to twenty sights within that city along with a city map. Usually, each attraction gets about a four-paragraph write-up plus a photograph. A few major attractions (e.g. Louvre, British Museum, St. Peter's Cathedral, etc.) are devoted two to four pages plus a larger diagram. Also, each country usually has another dozen or so pages covering its history and culture as well as a discussion about practical information such as climate, banking, methods of travel, shopping, etc.The book doesn't teach you everything you need to know about Europe (e.g. nothing about foreign languages), or will want to know (e.g. hotels, restaurants, and food have modest coverage). Nor does it include everything you'll do - only places, not events, are written about (e.g. Oktoberfest only warrants a photo). But the book does an excellent job at detailing what popular, famous, interesting, or important places there are in Europe. The pictures and illustrations make the book come to life. The maps help you judge the relative positions of sights within a particular city. The descriptions are usually detailed enough so you can determine how interesting you'll find a particular place. Some people might criticize the book because it doesn't judge how "good" each sight is. However, I find this nice because everyone has different tastes and I like to have the opportunity form my own opinions.If you want to know what is available to see in Europe then this is the book for you.

review/summary: Going to Europe? Get this book!
review/text: If you're already a fan of the Eyewitness Travel Guide series, you know what to expect from this book. If this is your first time, let me tell you you'll be amazed with how great and how useful this book is.This particular guide summarizes the contents of over 20 other books by DK, including information for 20 countries in total, organized in the following way:- The British Isles (Great Britain &amp; Ireland)- France and the low countries (France, Belgium, Luxembourg &amp; The Netherlands)- The Iberian Peninsula (Spain &amp; Portugal)- Italy and Greece- Germany, Austria and Switzerland- Scandinavia (Sweden, Norway, Denmark &amp; Finland)- Central and Eastern Europe (Czech Republic, Hungary &amp; Poland).This guide contains, for every country, information regarding sites to visit, hotels, restaurants, shopping, museums, travel info (how tos for travelling by train, bus, car, metro, etc). Worthy of notice are their trademark cutaways of castles and churches, maps and street-by-street graphics.The only drawback is that since it includes information on so many countries, some of it might not have the detail you'd expect. For example, the France section has only 73 pages, while the Eyewitness Travel Guide to Paris (another book from DK) has over 350 pages on Paris alone!A phenomenal guide if you're planning on visiting many countries on one trip, but if you intend to dedicate more time to just a couple, you'd be better off getting the specific country/city guides.

review/summary: The Major Sights in Twenty Countries - Amazing!
review/text: Yes, this is one heavy book. It is more than likely not a guide you want to carry around with you unless you intend to lose a few pounds from the extra weight in your backpack. Otherwise, it is quite a great guide for deciding where you want to take your next vacation in Europe. It is filled with color photography, illustrations and details you wil enjoy reading. It is graphically exciting and visually pleasing. Of all the guides I've seen, the Eyewitness Travel Guides are sheer brillance.On the inside cover there is a map of Europe and then the pages are color coded so you can find the following countries: Great Britian, Ireland, France, Belgium & Luxembourge, The Netherlands, Spain, Portugal, Italy, Greece, Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Finland, Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland.So, if you wanted to find the information on France, you just turn the book sideways and look for the yellow markings on the pages. Viola, you are there. If you are dreaming about visiting the Eiffel Tower, the Louvre or want to go see the Hall of Mirrors at the Chateau de Versailles, may I say...they are worth a plane ticket to France. Finding a bottle of Huile D' Olive in the South of France is also something you won't soon forget.There is also a guide to Europe's Rail Network and the Index is perfect.After you look through the main spots to visit in each country, there is a section filled with practical information: Visa Requirements and customs, tourist information, personal security issues, climate, banking, communications, directory for embassies, travel information like car rental and buses, etc. Then there is a shopping and entertainment. So where do you want to stay? There is a guide giving the hotel ratings and it is divided up by the areas you might enjoy visiting. Then, there is a guide to places to eat. While finding a restaurant just by exploring can be exciting, there is something to be said for a guide. Unless of course you happen to be traveling with someone who knows the country and I can imagine that is the best way to travel. Is there a lonely Frenchman out there who wants to show me Paris? SighJust kidding, but hey, a fantasy is a fantasy.So, think of this guide as an overview and then you can select an Eyewitness Travel Guide for the specific countries of interest. They are all excellent although on a first trip to Europe, I'd advice a guided tour so you can enjoy your trip instead of worrying about language barriers, etc.If you go to Paris, take a tour because I would not drive there if you paid me a million bucks! The highways in Germany are also equally terrifying. Everyone is in such a hurry to get to nowhere. If you want to enjoy your vacation without as many hassles, a tour might be the way to go. There is nothing quite like being guided through the most gorgeous cities in Europe.This guide is just the start to many adventures.~The Rebecca Review

review/text: Eyewitness travel guides are splendid and this is not an exception. This is a handy guide to Europe and shows some of the more popular spots to travel to. I was a bit confused that not all countries were included. However, that might be because they picked the places that most people travel to. I personally was a bit disapointed that Romania, Ukraine and other more far eastern european countries were not included. However, still and all, this is an awesome guide for the countries that are included. I love how they show everything instead of just writing and writing like many travel guides do. These are the best guides out there and the many photos make these guides stupendous and astounding and many leagues better then closest competitor.

review/summary: Helpful guide on tours through Europe
review/text: I recently took a backpack trip through Europe, which lasted close to a month; before heading out there I went through a few guidebooks and at that moment this one appealed the most. I cannot say if it was the presentation with the colored photographs; maps of the cities with visitor information or that I was just to plain sick of spending time searching for a guide book to take me though my journey. Nonetheless I am quite pleased that I took this guide with me. I had planned initially to visit a friend in Netherlands and spend some time scrolling through the cities; I left my guide there to my host; but off and on I would reference the book with places I visited; I must admit that this book covered all the places. Now of course I personally feel the best way to visit a place is to have some one show you around as like any other travel guide will not detail the places where the locals would head over to; like the bars, restraunts and night clubs. My visit from here lead me to Paris; it hit me with all its charm and glamour; here too I was fortunate to be taken around by friends. The real use of the guide came when I went on a solo journey to Belgium Austria and Italy. I found this guide an immense source of information. On my way to the city mostly by trains; I found the chance to orient myself and somewhat have a time frame as to how long I would stay in each city. I found that even though the book has information about hotels and hostels but at the train station's Hotel Guides; I was always able to get better deals. Pretty much I carried this heavy 800 pages book with me where ever I went.Even though this book provides immense information I would highly recommend getting additional reference books on cities, which are known, for immense sightseeing and historical attractions. One such place where the guide fell short was Florence; even tough it has considerable information and provides all the most popular sites. It literally will take a 1000 pages to detail all the places to visit; as a comparison there are over 78 places to visit which have historical importance but the book has listed only about the best 14 of them; well visiting all the places would take a few weeks of stay in comparison to a typical 3-4 days that tourists generally spend; which is sufficient time to visit the places listed in the book. Another important place not mentioned in this test was the "Museum of Arsenal" in Vienna; here on display is the car in which duke Ferdinand traveled with in Sarajevo.On the whole this covers only the most western countries of Europe and leaves a lot of East European countries and Turkey as well.

review/summary: The Quick Trip Around Europe!
review/text: This guide is great for an overview of many of the great places in Europe - but I cannot believe anyone would consider using this as their only guide. It should be used to maybe narrow down places to visit- then more comprehensive guides should be used. I have never been a believer in those 1 and 2 days in 18 cities over 3 weeks tours. 1 or 2 days is certainly not enough time to fully appreciate and get to know any city you visit. Furthermore, this guides biggest flaw is in doesn't cover anything in central/eastern europe besides the Czech Republic, Poland, and Hungary! Where's Russia, Romania, Bulgaria, the Baltic States, etc....? Yes, Europe is big but the countries not contained in this guide have so much to offer and certainly should not be overlooked. For example, St. Petersburg is one of the most beautiful cities in Europe - not mentioned here!Don't rush Europe - relax and enjoy it. Take time to get to know the people and cities. This guide can certainly help to narrow down Europe - but should certainly not be relied upon for extensive info on the many great places.

review/text: This is a condensed and abridged book covering most of Europe. It gives you the highlights of the countries of Western Europe. It is a good book if you planning a trip where you will spend a day or two in many places. Otherwise you should consider DK more comprehensive guides to a particular country, region or city. On the positive side the book covers several countries that DK does not have a guide for yet. On the down side, the only Eastern European countries covered are Poland, the Czech Republic, and Hungary. Also the book is heavy. Is the book worth the money? Only if you are taking a &quot;buffet&quot; tour of Europe (a little France, a little Italy, etc...).

review/summary: Great Guide to Europe!
review/text: I just returned from a two-week tour of Western Europe and this book was simply fantastic. Obviously you can't cover everything you could possibly do in Europe in 800 pages, but this book covered more than many of the other Europe tomes. I had this book and one other with me on my trip and this was the only book I opened the entire journey.The best part about this book was all of the illustrations and color photographs. This book shows you what the other guides only tell you. It's hard to tell what building your looking at if you only have a written description, but with the four color illustrations in this book things are easy to identify and find. I would recommend this book to anyone taking a trip to Europe. (Plus, when you get back from your trip this book can even help you identify all those photographs you took)

No one book could be comprehensive, and all Europe guides are pretty bulky and heavy. But the Eyewitness people have managed to fit an astonishing number of places into 800 pages - and their choices are always exactly right, especially for the first-time visitor. It can be hard to decide whether to go to Antwerp or Bruges or Brussels - if you only have time to go to one city in Belgium - and all the photographs and illustrations in this book, plus the informative descriptions, make it a lot easier to make up your mind. The maps alone, all in color, make it worth buying.

review/summary: Great when assisted by another guide
review/text: This guide is great when considering what sites and places to visit. It covers most any city you might find yourself visiting. It does a great job of describing the sites and the history behind them. Does not help with city transportation. Lightly covers the character of each city. I do enjoy the pictures and diagrams in the book. I highly recommend having another guide book that covers more logistics. I used this book along with Rick Steves Europe 2007. They were great companions to one another. My other complaint is that I am a student with a budget. This book does not cover many (if any) cheap places to eat or sleep. It does tell you which places charge admission, but does not tell you the admission price. It is a great book when accompanied by another (like Lonely Planet or Rick Steves.)

review/text: From Memphis, TN. comes The Reatards, fronted, of course, by wild kid Jay Reatard. He starting off on Eric Oblivians label, Goner, at the tender age of 15. Jay, now 19, is still rocking and offending the sensibilities of his community. Overdriven, loud, crackling guitars underlaying Jay's southern crooning howl energizes some of the most amazing hate-filled song writing we've heard in years.

review/summary: there's still life on Earth
review/text: The Reatards' music is really something that hasn't nothing to do with common and usual comments and impressions on someone's music. This record(and their first record too)is not for everyone. All of the essence of true Punkrock, of true Rock And Roll is in their songs. I mean that their sound is BEFORE and OVER the concept of music, songwriting and melody: it's really something SUPERIOR. It comes directly from HEART, from SOUL, without any mediation, any reflection; it is the real, concrete expression of the Plato's concept of Sublime. The first feedback you have from their record is the sensation that The Reatards have an incredible urgency to express their HATE; but I really think that it actually is LOVE,LOVE,LOVE from a HEART with a DIVINE INSPIRATION. In their songs, in their screams, in their unbelievable, uncontrollable urge and fury there's a strong light from God, from Dyonisus. The covers of old punk-favorites are many, but the originals are better: &quot;Tonight it'll come&quot; stands as the &quot;Chinese Rocks&quot; of the third millennium. Along with The Oblivians(from Memphis too), the best band of the 90's.

review/text: To listen to the Reatards second record, &quot;grown up, fucked up&quot;, is to be able to place your head inside a black and white Zenith television set with your mouth wide open and choke on the dusty cables inside. Each song is nothing but a teaser of such maniacal rock frenzy fuzz that is barely tolerable, even to the strong at heart. But, thats the beauty. Memphis never sounded so good being portrayed by three lads who stare at the sun, while sweating out electric frustration on their living room floors.

He does everything from shooting a buffalo while riding a horse, to bowfishing under water and shooting a large shark. He even has a technical chapter on bowmaking, and his style of shooting. Any archer will enjoy reading this book.

review/summary: The Best Archery Book I've Ever Read!
review/text: Hunting the Hard Way is the best book I have ever read. This book is about the adventures of Howard Hill and others that accompanied him on his hunting trips. Howard Hill used a laminated bamboo longbow that he made in his archery shop. He was an excellent shot with the bow also. He took some amazing shots at animals in this book. The most amazing shot in my opinion was at an elk at over 150 yards! He also went hunting with his bow and arrow.

review/text: The first 2 chapters of this book locked this reader to the pages like an arrow nocked to the string. The thoughts and feelings expressed by Howard Hill as he came to full draw on each of his adventures put me in the saddle or atop the mountain looking through his eyes. Any archer's heart will race at the reaccounting of each hunt, but only archers of traditional caliber will be able to appreciate the flight of the arrow as it's loosed and hits its intended mark. The bond between fellow hunters is well expressed and gives proper account to the knowledge and wisdom passed down at the campfire by older more experienced hunters. But for the fact that Howard Hill has accomplished things with his bow that I wouldn't begin to consider, I found it difficult to associate with some of his underwater adventures.

review/text: If you are involved with archery, this book belongs in your library. Howard Hill posessed skills that are nothing short of incredible when it came to hunting and target archery. This book will inspire you to pick up your bow and go out and shoot. It might even inspire someone to but down his compound and pick up a real bow. This book is a compilation of accounts from Howards career that would be written off as fantasy if so many people hadn't witnessed what Howard was able to accomplish with a longbow. Howard attempts to describe making bows and other archery tackle. I wouldn't buy the book for these reasons. There are other sources such as the bowyer's bible series that do a much better job.

review/summary: An entertaining panorama on magics and demon
review/text: Seligmann, an artist and a &quot;bibliophiliac&quot; of twentieth century, presents a noteworthy panorama on the roots of magic and ancient beliefs &amp; superstitions in this richly illustrated work. This is not a book an enthustiastic &quot;Wicca&quot; would be enjoyed or feel excited to read. Rather it is a well organized collection of historical accounts (mostly dealing with the &quot;Western&quot; side of the subject) and esoteric knowledge. Seligmann provides us a classified history of magic, beginning with ancient Mesopotamia, Persia, Egypt, Canaan and Greece; then shifts the main route towards the medieaval Europe. All sections concerning with ancient cultures has very interesting details on ancient rituals, myths and the concept of &quot;demons&quot;. He especially provides very interesting material on Hermetic philosophy and gnosticism. The hundreds of illustrations in the book, add an entertaining taste into the story. This book would have well deserved &quot;five stars&quot; if it included ancient Eastern beliefs and rites in same detailed style, so I rate Seligmann's work with 4 stars. But in general, &quot;The History of Magic and Occult&quot; is a &quot;compact encyclopedia&quot;, you'd like to own.

It's very 'academic', which I often find is synonomous with dry. I understand why the flashy New Age books sell - they capture the audience who doesn't go for the more scholarly approach... and I have difficult reading this book without my mind wandering.That said - it's not about flash, it's about substance... and it is a very interesting and informative piece of works.

After every story I had to sit back an process the incredible story I had just read. Rivera-Valdez uses her ease with words to paint not just a portrait of each character, but a landscape. Not only are you able to fully enjoy the secrets in the stories, but you will find yourself wondering what goes on behind your own neighbors' curtains.

review/summary: A Painful Read... Break Out the Coffee
review/text: The topic explored by the author is the practice of forgery in late Antiquity to substantiate a religious cult's legitimacy. As a revised version of the author's doctoral thesis and his first book, it has page after page of unnecessary excerpts whose sole purpose seems to be to let the reader know that the author really has passed his language proficiency exams. These are then followed an apology trying to explain why they really were worth quoting. It is a very boring read. Besides these stylistic annoyances, the entire structure of the book takes the form of a survey of various instances of pseudepigrapha... which are then dutifully stretched back to the initial lackluster thesis. There are no fantastic insights in this book. Unless you are doing a specialization in this field, I would not recommend buying this book. There are many better books in the study of religion to be savored. If you must have it for a specialization, I would recommend finding it at a university library... though it may have a limited availability since it is only a revamped standard doctoral thesis that is not widely applicable in many areas of study.

review/summary: It was published. That's an accomplishment.
review/text: First, this text is not the source of the interrelation between Mediterranean Sea cultures. Every book on Hellenistic kingdoms or the Roman Empire presupposes (or should) interrelation of cultures because those political boundaries encompassed a variety of cultures. (A "specialist" should know this.) This text is just what it says: a chronicle of Homer and Moses citings.Second, other authors have expounded on this topic: they have, and they will again. I'm not going to explain in depth here because to do so would be to give away my doctoral thesis. I don't particularly want to see someone else take my sources, present my argument, and have my book published under his/her name.Third, it is extremely difficult to write a doctoral thesis, from my experience. So, while I cannot say that it is the best work on the topic, I think we should have sympathy for doctoral student writers. It is publish or perish, after all. At least it was published. I can only hope for so much for myself.Whether or not you the reader purchase this book is a matter of your own choice. Having to go back to the library for it too often is an indication that one is using it as a reference and not looking to the original sources. That is ill-advised. (Of course, libraries are the friends of "specialists.") But if you have money, and it would make you happy just to peruse every now and then... then by all means give your financial support to Amazon and the author.

review/text: The screen arrived in a cardboard box that was pretty beat up. The screen itself is very lightweight, very cheesy looking. The "finish" was worn across the entire top of the screen.

review/text: We were surprised. Pleasantly.A weighty, perfect model of this classic screen would certainly not be available for anything close to the price of the Uniflame model, but the Uniflame looks amazingly good anyway. This thing does the trick!We bought it to replace an "original" solid brass model costing nearly $500 (and it's cheap construction design eventually giving way to its heaviness when moved). As long as someone doesn't examine the new screen from close-up, it actually looks better (not really terrible at all close-up), and it's lighter weight makes it easy to handle.JRT

review/summary: Scraped across the whole top.
review/text: Purchased this screen last week and it came with noticeable scrapes across the top. The box it came in was gigantic with plenty of packaging material, but the screen was packaged loosely at the bottom. However, since it was in another smaller box, I'm thinking that the scraping was there to begin with, and not from shipping. Still deciding whether to go through the trouble of exchanging it since another reviewer said they had the same damage. I wouldn't want to risk getting another with the same damage and I really need a screen right now. Other than the damage, it's a very nice screen.

It's light enough that it can be moved with ease, but still feels sturdy enough that it should last for years to come. Great product, great experience.

review/summary: Great Music - Packaging Needs Help
review/text: I'm not sure if the effects of the CD can match the claim or not (we shall see...) but the music IS really, really good. Very trancey, some dancey and lots of tribal/world music & atmospheric sounds. If you like Delirium, Enigma or downbeat/chill you will love this album a lot. It's definitely more 'modern' sounding and uses many different virtual instrumentation passages that are artfully arranged. Nicely recorded as well. I love popping this in and driving to work during my 'alone time', it really helps inspire some great visualizations (for me). However, don't expect fancy packaging: I thought the price was a bit steep for receiving a store bought slimline jewel case with a one-sided paper handmade insert. And the disc itself is blank. You have to be aware of what side you are putting in because there is absolutely no artwork or print on it. I've made my own cds before, and for a tiny bit extra they could have had the CDs printed at least, or had regular sized jewel cases....but that's just my personal taste perhaps. I also know that musicians are screwed out of their money in lots of other ways so maybe the extra price is partly Amazon's cut and only a portion goes to the artist (I don't doubt). Besides, it's always nice to support independent artists, so I didn't really mind. Either way, it is really lovely and unusual music for you to meditate to, groove to or imagine to. I usually have it on at work all day...I recommend it.

review/summary: Profound then. Truly horrible now.
review/text: The narrative style of this work by famous founders' biographer John Morse is arrogant, flippant and frequently exaggerated. It carries the tone of the amateur Yankee historian on high, passing judgment on this Southern statesman who was neither from Boston nor a Harvard graduate. Perhaps considered penetrating for its day, it really represents nothing more than opinion today. The research is so thin that one must conclude that Morse wrote the entire manuscript essentially from memory, with little reference to the primary and secondary sources we expect of historians now. If it weren't for the fact that Morse wrote this piece 110 years ago, I'd have rated it only one star.

review/summary: pretty good, especially for the younger kids (2-3 years plus)
review/text: I think this one is our favourite game for my younger daughter. She could play this when she was 2.5 years and loved it. It may be a bit simple for the older kids (6+) as they will do it fairly quickly as there are not many challenges or puzzles to solve.This is more of an art game than a challenge game - lots of decorating with the 6 different paintbrushes (each creates a different scene) and there are many decorate it yourself items like making flowers for the garden, making the masks and the decorating the thrones. There is no wrong way to do them (you can't get decorating wrong like you can with the puzzles).The only negative would be the maze at the end, you have to move with the arrow keys and this I always have to help her with as it is a bit difficult. The graphics are great, sound great and my favourite is most of the game is done with the mouse so it is easy for kids (not like the Pegasus game which is terrible!). Older kids may prefer the Princess and the Pauper game if they want a game that lasts longer.

review/summary: A fun game for younger Barbie fans
review/text: My three year old adores this game. The game only takes 2-3 hours to complete in one sitting, but my child has played it over and over, and still loves it. The box recommends this game for ages 5 and older, but my daughter can play this game by herself with ease, except for the maze (which is fairly easy, but she needs help working the arrow keys). This game is mostly a "paint" type game, where you decorate different rooms in a castle in order to save Prince Stephan and the castle. You paint and place different decorations about the castle, as well as "build" a planter and a mosaic tile. The game and the decorations are quite cute, and easy for young Barbie fans to do independently. I feel it does have some educational value as well, in that my daughter seems to have improved her mouse skills from playing this game, has grasped concepts like clicking a "done" button when she has completed a task, and seems to have become better at listening to directions. My one and only complaint is that I wish there had been just a couple more rooms in the castle to decorate. Still, for a fairly short game, it has lots of replay value in it, and the length is just right for a young attention span. I would recommend this game to people with young children who are Barbie fans, especially if their kids aren't quite ready for the more advanced thinking that games geared for older kids have. Don't get me wrong, I think older Barbie fans will like this game, too, if they want to play a game that mostly centered on decorating. I've had problems finding games that my daughter can play independently at her age, plus she's a huge Barbie fan, so this game was perfect for us.

review/text: I purchased this for my daughter that had just turned 5 and with a little help from me in the maze area she was able to finish the game rather quickly (hence the 4 stars instead of 5) but to my surprise she still wants to play it over and over again redecorating the castle differently each time room, by room. She has figured out the maze area on her own now as well, at first naviagating Barbie is a little difficult, but all in all as a rainy day game she loves it! Sometimes I have to set the timer to get her off the computer. Not a lot in the way of learning, but that is what her "Reader Rabbit" CD-Rom's are for anyway - this one is for fun! Additionally I didnot have any technical problems setting up this CD for my daughter, and I have had with many others including her Reader Rabbit, and Disneys.

review/summary: Kids love it...but has annoying flaw
review/text: The kids have played this a lot, and it does seem to stimulate their creativity. To start the child enters her name...later, her name shows up during the game. It only takes them a couple of hours to go through the whole adventure. Of course, it is good enough they want to play it again. But to start over from the beginning, you must enter a new name. We started with their names, then went to full names, now on initials...next I guess we'll have to put in the dog's name. The login page has all these name variations on it, and is becoming ridiculously long. Wrote to tech support, and got the following reply:The response to your question:----------------------------------------Solution Added On 12/31/2002 2:29PMThis is true. The only way to go on is to create a new game with a new name.---------------------Well, that was very helpful.

review/summary: Educational and Fun
review/text: I have always encouraged outdoor exercise instead of the computer, however I don't mind my 5 year old daughter playing with this game. It teaches them creativity, puzzle solving, logic and listening comprehension. Barbie gives them hints if they come to an impasse and presents a certificate with their name on it when they navigate through a maze, which is a great tool for self-esteem, confidence and accomplishment.The graphics and sound are superb,and it will not intimidate first time users. I highly recommend this CD-Rom for ages 4 and up-it is worth the price paid. Lisa Horne

review/text: This game requires quicktime 5.0 to work...if you have a better version of quicktime (I have 7.5), it will ask you to install the quicktime available on the CD...if you click no, it will not let you play. So, I begrudgingly clicked yes on the third try, and it installed quicktime 5, THEN it tells me to please install the quicktime available on the disc. It KEPT telling me that, even after I uninstalled my version of quicktime 7.5, and reinstalled Barbie Rapunzel and quicktime 5. Very frustrating, and the game absolutely will not work for me. It keeps telling me over and over, to install quicktime 5, tho I've been through the installation process repeatedly. It is NOT my "operating system limitations". This is a brand new computer...merely weeks old with all the state of the art contraptions.

review/summary: Mac Users Beware
review/text: We were glad to find a Barbie PC game that can run on a Mac. However, note that the requirements to run the game on a Mac are: Power Mac, G3 266 MHz or faster processor, Mac OS 8.6, 9.1.2, 9.2, or 10.1.2. We have a Mac running OS 10.2.8 (just the next version). I assumed the game would still be compatible since most software can run on an OS that is slightly greater than the one required. This game will not work with OS 10.2.8 at all. I planned on calling Apple to see if there was some plug-in/fix I could download to make it work, but never got around to it.Luckily, my Mom has a Windows PC, so my 5 year old daughter gets to play the game when she goes to Grandma's house. She LOVES the game and has not gotten tired of it at all (but she can play once or twice a month). The concept is fun and straight forward, and has more than 1 level. She got the game when she was 4 and had no problems learning how to use it, but she's always been pretty good on the computer.

review/text: I bought this very rich program for my bright 4 year-old who has significant problems with patience and focus/attention. She likes the video very much. This video has been very helpful in rewarding her for working patiently and methodically. At the same time it is great for teaching shapes, use of color, and fine motor control.

review/summary: This is an excellent game!!
review/text: If you haven't already gotten this game for either your child or yourself, I personally recommend it VERY much. It is one of the best computer games for children I have ever seen. I recently got it for my daughter, and it is a very interesting game. There are lots of activities on the game, even printable items. It is a great learning game for any child because, while they think it's a fun game, it also teaches children some basic computer and everyday skills. I love this and I'm a mother, so I'm sure that you will be satisfied with this. I was very surprised at how great it is. I suggest that if you are looking for a great computer game for a young one, this would be THE one to get. I really recommend this!!

It is essentially just clicking on the screen to make it play the 7 or 8 scenes it has programmed. There are no games to play, nothing to figure out, nothing to do. Save your money.

I recommend this game for any 4-8 year old girl.

review/summary: Barbie Rupenzel CD - Good but annoying parts
review/text: I'm StoryMaker. Me, Russian Blue Witch, and Chocolate Dog borrowed it from a friend who has lots of computer games and I'm jeolus. Anyways, I'm a good artist. I love art. Only I can find this a little bad. Something that really really really really annoys me is you can only fit 12 names on the sign-in list! That is NOT average, I read you can fit 99 names on other games. And since this is like other games and you need to start a new user for a new game after me and RBW and C-Dog played it a few times whenever we tried to type a name in the box it gave us an error message that said that the list is full and you press Ctrl and D to delete a name or something and I counted the users...there are 12. And it is hard to choose what things to use and I like the things where you don't choose from things and it annoys me in those things you can't get out of the lines even though you're using a P-brush. Espeaking of p-brushes the p-brush in the 'choose' thing it is annoying because you can't to half-n-half! And after you do something, you can't change it and when you're done and go to the maskarade ball there ussaly is no mask! What I mean is Barbie is not holding a mask, just a stick with a feather on it. Signed, StoryMaker. "Gotta trust the kid's review!"

review/summary: barbie rapunzel = crying child
review/text: My 6-year old daughter is currently sobbing in her bedroom as a result of this rotten game.She spent an hour on this game painting in pretty pictures and coloring in flowers. But halfway through the game, the program hung, and wouldn't let us leave the room or click anywhere else. Now even if we exit the game and then start it back up, we are frozen in one spot while Barbie's disembodied voice urges us to "explore somewhere else in the castle."Standard software troubleshooting and rebooting didn't help. Vivendi Games' support site is "currently disabled." And now I'm left with a weeping, frustrating child who doesn't understand that it is not her fault that her game won't work. I'm hoping it was just incompetent software programming that couldn't catch the bug my 6-year old caught the first time around. Or maybe they just don't care about the problems, so long as you get our 20 bucks. If you don't want a crying little girl, avoid this game!

review/summary: DEFECTIVE PRODUCT FOR MACINTOSH! RIP OFF ALERT!
review/text: DO NOT PURCHASE THIS ITEM IF YOU HAVE A MACINTOSH!!! It ONLY runs on "Classic OS 9", which is an operating system over 8 years old. It does NOT run on OS X at all. A HUGE disappointment and clearly false advertising! Also, the company, BSL Mart, is very difficult to contact. There is no phone number, you can only send them e-mails. Also, the return slip was already peeled off on the packaging slip, so it is obvious that someone else already returned it and BSL Mart just slapped it right back in the package and shipped it off again anyway without even looking at it. My 5-year old daughter was so upset -- we had ordered this as a reward for her good behavior as well as doing her chores and the game is so out-dated it won't even work on a Mac OS 10.3.9 - the Panther version, which was the lowest operating system we could find. PATHETIC. I also placed this in dispute with my Visa card company, and they did put it in dispute but also informed me that in order for it to stick I have to get a "second opinion letter" from a "qualified merchant" who knows about video games! So I HAVE TO DO THE LEGWORK TO GET THIS $[...] removed from my bill - not BSL Mart! You talk about furious. I will never do business with them again. I also will never purchase a game from Amazon unless the ad SPECIFICALLY states hat it will run on a CURRENT operating system. (DUH?!) If there had been a phone number to call before I purchased it I would have but there is none. SAD.

review/summary: Great fun for kids!
review/text: My review is targeted toward those that wish this game for their toddler age kids. I purchased this for my 3 year old daughter. She is a huge fan of the Barbie animated movies and Rapunzel is one of her favorites. This game is so much fun for her! It definately keeps her attention span for long periods of time...which is saying something for a toddler! The game is easy for her to use. This is a good thing because she is very stubborn and independant...she does not like mommy and daddy helping her. Basically, the evil Gothel has cast a spell over the castle and turned the Prince into stone. To win, you must complete each level (which is just transforming it from dark and gloomy into bright and cheery) and then travel through a maze to rescue the Prince. To transform each room, the player gets to pick out paint colors, decorate different accessories in the room, etc. There are plenty of different options for each room to keep the little ones happy! I could defintely see how this would be entertaining for kids of different ages...perfect for siblings with a few years in age difference. I have recently purchased the 12 Dancing Princesses game and it is not anywhere near being as good or entertaining as this one!

review/text: My daughter absolutely loves this game! It's easy to use and requires no adult supervision. Best of all, it allows girls to use their creativity to design their own castle one room at a time. What more could a girl want! My daughter wants to play it every day and I have to find excuses to keep her away! Too bad not all the Barbie games are this easy and fun. I've been very disappointed in others I purchased. I discovered that they're not all designed/published by the same company. I paid 5.99 for this game on clearance and it's been worth 10 times this amount!

review/text: My 6 and 7 year old daughters love this game! They really enjoy decorating the rooms and doing so has really improved their mouse skills. Essentially, a lot of the game is kind of like "coloring" on the computer and they love to color. Hunting for the gems in each room is fun for them. There is also a maze at the end as well as a bunch of sappy songs that they seem to really enjoy. This is a great choice for girls 4-9 years old.

review/text: My daughters both love this game. Aged 3 and 4, they're already fairly adept computer users, but this game is really particularly well designed for their ages. They love the story line (somewhat different from the movie) and the challenge of having to find all the gems to save the prince. The activities in the game are ones that they play over and over - especially the painting, mosaic puzzle, and design-your-own flowers. They really get to use their creativity, and the tools they can use in the game are really beautiful. We have a lot of kids' computer games, and this one is their hands-down favorite.

And whenever you want to go someplace else you have to click arrows up and down. This game was not fun b/c when you click the arrows up and down it goes somewhere else you do not want it to be at.

review/text: My 3 year old daughter & I both love this software. We actually fight over who is going paint the pictures or choose the themes for each room. This game allows you to be creative & use your imagination by "decorating" each room of the castle and finding the missing gems to the prince's crown which gives Rapunzel the power to find Prince Stephan who has been turned to stone & bring him back to life. The music & animation is the best I have seen. Most of the kids software that I've seen is boring to me as an adult, but this is not at all. I sometimes like to play it without her! There are so many variations on color schemes & patterns & that you can never be bored. I highly recommend this for girls of all ages.

After seeing it many times on her "wish list" I warned her that it would most likely be boring. Boy was I wrong! We have spent many rainy day hours decorating rooms and having such fun. You can do so much and make it so different each time. We decide on colors and themes of rooms and go to town. I gave her a big hug and kiss for being so persistant about getting this software.

review/text: I would definitely recommend buying this CD. My 5 year old loved it. It is visually breathtaking and will engage young ones for hours. The only drawback is that you only get to redecorate the castle. There is no variation to the tasks so that once you've completed the castle, if you want to play again, you do exactly what you had done before but there is a great deal of variety and combinations for decorating the castle. It is like a very sophisticated coloring book.

review/text: My 5-year-old daughter LOVED this game. It developed her creativity and held her attention long enough to finish it in one sitting. She still loves the theme song, which she memorized immediately. My two complaints: 1) Once you have completed the entire game, you must sign in under a different name in order to play again. 2) The game has no variations or higher levels to challenge the player as her skill improves. My daughter finished the game on her first attempt in about 45 minutes, but as she played more and became familiar with where all the items were, it took less and less time to finish a game. She's starting to become bored with it.One last thing (and I guess you can count this as complaint #3): will game developers EVER come up with something for girls that challenges their critical skills and doesn't involve dressup or makeovers?

review/summary: Not so good - ok for a rental!
review/text: This game is pretty exciting and it is very nice and it is really creative and one of a kind. The only bad thing is that there is only one "castle" for the kids to "decorate" and once you are done with the whole castle that is basically it. You either have to create a new username for yourself to do it all over again or you get another game like I did. My sister finished the "castle" in about 2 hours and after that has never even looked at this game anymore. It is a nice game and it is fun but it is not really worth that much money.

They love everything about it, from the theme song at the beginning, to finding Prince Stefan in the maze at the end. I will admit, it's not super educational, but it does keep them entertained and it's nice to have a "fun" game once in awhile that doesn't require them to think too hard! It's also nice because they can leave the game midway, and return back to where they left off by clicking on their name. The names can also be deleted so that they can start a fresh game. They can restore the castle over and over again and have it be different every time. I think it was totally worth the money.

review/summary: Great,maybe for a 10 year old...
review/text: Hi,I'm 'BARBIE LOVER' and I really like this game,even though I'm a bit out of the age range. :) I like going around and decorating every room in the castle differently each time I play!(like the whole castle decorated with peacocks or swans or butterflies,or one room has horses and another masqarade masks,exc.)The thing which really nags me is that every time you have 12 names on your list you have to erase one to play again.I usually just erase the whole list so I won't have to do this that often. I also like the intro to the game,and the muscic in each room before you restore it. I even reconized a bit of music from the movie! If you love Fantasy,dragons,and rapunzel you should get the movie-and this very fun game!(The movie is very nice,even though it is 4 years old!)And another thing-Barbie's mask is not a mask-it is just a feather in the air-have you seen it? PS Please vote on my review! 'BARBIE LOVER'

review/summary: NOT OS X but MAC CLASSIC
review/text: NEGATIVE: This game does not work with OS X and requires the CD so you can't have it on multiple computers. It is slow I have to tell my daughter that it is thinking a lot, this is because it has to access the CD everytime there is a new task. You can't view the openning sequence again without throwing out the saved game files. Some of the tasks and controls are too hard and not user friendly even for adults.it CRASHES all the time.Mouse is jumpy and hard to use.POSITIVE: Some tasks are easy, possible to use, grand and beautiful.My three year has enough patience to survive the multiple trials to get this to work.

review/summary: Over all, an okay game
review/text: My daughters have both enjoyed playing this game. One of them is 6 yrs. old and the other is 3 1/2 yrs. old. and they both have had no trouble mastering this game. The down side to this game is that it is redundant/repeatitive. It is the same things over and over again, only you can change the patterns and colors of the items you are working on. In order to be able to play again after you have completed it, you must go and remove their name from the sign-in page 'then' retype it! This little chore is very annoying after awhile. The graphics are very nice and colorful and it does allow your child to use her imagination and to be creative, but all in all , I think the game was way too pricey for what it is. After having this in our house for 4 months, my girls have become rather bored with it.

review/summary: Simple Game - Started My Daughter on Computers
review/text: This game got my daughter started on computers when she was 2. She is 6 now and a computer wizard for her age. When she was 2, I had to get the game up and running and give her a hand frome time to time, but she learned to work independently. The game has two modes: storybook and interactive. Your child can view the story or they can help Barbie at many steps along the way. My daughter jumped to interactive right away. This game may be to simple for Kids over 5. The game can also help young girls feel comfortable with using a computer and learn to load games and use a mouse.

review/summary: good but pricey
review/text: Images are pretty, nice combination of colors, and is well done. My 4 year old daughter loves it at first and only took her a couple of hours to complete the adventure (she did need some adult help to get her started and more help to go through the maze). After that, she doesn't play with it as much ... and thus why I think it's pricey ... Not quite a learning experience as the Jump Start series.

review/text: I bought this for my 5 year old daughter. She LOVES this CD-ROM! It has excellent graphics and is easy for her to navigate through. It has many different options in how you "restore" the castle and keeps her interest up. I would recommend this product. It even has a print option to print pages from the scrapbook of rooms you have restored.

review/text: My daughter loved this game, and it really kepted her at the computer for hours, but it was finished in one day at our house. It was a long day, but still one day. The positives about the game though is that they can go back and redecorate the castle different the next time they play, so my dayghter actually played it again a few days later so she could see what the castle would look like if she decorated it differently.

review/text: BARBIE AS RAPUNZEL: A CREATIVE ADVENTURE. I don't like Barbie, yet even with my negative attitude I appreciated the Barbie as Rapunzel adventure. This is a creative game in which the player must help Barbie free Prince Stefan from an evil spell by restoring a cursed and very run-down castle. The player takes Barbie around the castle and selects colors and patterns to decorate with magic paintbrushes and wands. Once each room is redecorated, Barbie retrieves a gem that will eventually be placed in the prince's crown to break the spell on him. The Barbie and Prince get to live in their renovated home - happily ever after, of course.

review/summary: Bad Deal!!
review/text: I ordered this DVD and received a substitute I never received the DVD I ordered from Importcds (the Vendor). I contacted them and did not recieve any feedback. I can't rate a DVD I have never seen. I didn't bother to send it back because it would have cost me more that I orginally paid for it. In the future I will watch for the name of the person and/or persons I am buying from. I thought they were a good company. I understand a simple mistake but, to not get a response at all is not good businees sense. I spend hundreds of dollars a month on Amazon.com building my DVD collection. I guess I will be more careful in the future.

review/text: I got this game, and the IT Expansion pack, deeply discounted at a game store. I must say that this is the first card game that I can actually relate to from personal experience. What fun. If you work in an office, and especially if you work in the IT department, this may be a fun game to play during lunch (in the rare event you do actually get to not work during lunch) or "after hours" with your friends. It will probably get old after a few plays, as the gags and cartoons are really funny only the first time one sees them, but it's great to play this game at least once just for laughs.

review/summary: Richardson's book a brilliant look at a mysterious person
review/text: This book combines two of the most sought-after items in a biography. First, in Williams, you have an intriguing, mysterious figure who not many people have much information on. Yes, he won the Heisman trophy and he is, publically, seen as a good person.What Richardson, the most respected college sports writer in the country, is able to do is look beyond the public perception and give readers a sense of what makes Williams tick and why Williams ticks the way he does.This book sets the stage for Williams in New Orleans. It is set before Williams' rookie year with the Saints and controversial coach Mike Ditka. After reading this book, you'll understand why Williams had the turbulent year and subsequent problems.Through a network of what seem to be unparalled contacts, Richardson is able to gain an insight on Williams the college player that has never before been exposed. He sets the table for Williams' rookie year. Much of the book explains how Williams was handled in college at Texas and why his transition to the real world has been so difficult.In short, this book is a must for any pro football fan. On a grand scale, it is much more than a work about Ricky Williams and the Saints. It chronicles the reasons college players have such a difficult time making the trasition to the professional level and explains why football is only part of that equation.

review/summary: Excellent book for handling feelings
review/text: This is my favorite parenting (and lifeskills) book for learning how to identify, process, and master one's feelings. It is so practical and really applies to any age of child/adult and parenting style. The goal of the book is to empower kids (and parents) to be responsible for their own feelings by identifying and handling them in appropriate ways.A variety of techniques are recommended depending on the age of the child and the child's own particular personality. (From art to music to reading to physical exercises and so much more).The author suggests that for each year of age a child has, they should develop that many coping mechanisms when they are upset for how to get their feelings under control and process them.This book strikes an excellent balance between the one extreme that says "You have no business feeling that way - just deal with it" which leads to stuffing emotions and angry outbursts, and the other extreme which focuses so much on talking about feelings "You're angry, you're upset, tell me how you feel, let's focus on your feelings for hours ad nauseum" that the child feels trapped by their own feelings and isn't given tools for moving beyond the situation.Highly highly recommend this book! You as the parent will also come away with new and better coping skills for yourself.

review/text: While the movie in itself was better than i expected what i didnt expect was the "non existent" Thai soundtrack. While the option was on the disc menu (as well as stated on the package) the Thai soundtrack does not exist. No matter what you choose, Thai or English, English is what you get and while there are some exceptions most dubbing is ridiculous at best and the dubbing on this title is sub par. While this review covers only the first movie of the two the other may remain in plastic never to see the inside of my dvd player. Its a shame and a sham when you purchase what claims to be original and is not. Very disapointed in this offering from Tokyo Shock.

This is among the last of the great SUC records. Not to say they've fallen off....just they've downsized so much with the deaths of the screw pioneers. Sad but true. If ya love Tx rap, you've gotta get this 1. Somethin to kickback & blow big too, somethin to jam in the ride. So underrated, right here. I wish people would forget all the bullsh** on BET/MTV and check what's happening in Houston. But i guess...it's sadly almost too late. Pat's gone, hawk's gone...screw, Moe, Pimp C, Big Steve. Makes me sad. Regardless, Pokey is still alive and making new music, keeping the legacy alive. And this is a great place to start with him. Classic record. Love it, man

But, I'll tell you, Pokey sounds a lot like Biggie Smalls (BIG). He has biggie's style, usin words like sho nuff. Pokey's lyrics are good, but a few lyrics could use a little work. A few of his songs have complex beats, but most have a little bit of a more simple beat. The album comes together great. Get it! Trust me...its worth the money

review/summary: Hamelin does it again
review/text: I confess to being a Hamelin fanatic! To me, Marc-Andre Hamelin is the best pianist performing today and I anxiously await new recordings by him. The Brahms is one of the greatest concertos ever written and it's one of my favorites. Hamelin plays it supperbly and the orchestra, under Litton's leadership, provides exceptional support. This is a "must have" CD for anyone who loves great piano playing. The Hyperion sound is fabulous, as usual too.

review/summary: Fun math!
review/text: My daughter received this for her third birthday. She was able to do level 1 (shapes) and level 2 (counting) pretty independently, if I separated the left and right side pieces from each other and told her she needed to pick one from each side. Having the bus to "frame" her pieces was helpful. I love that they put the number words under the numbers. After she found the match for six, she said "S-I-X makes six!" and was very proud of herself. We started doing level three, but only the addition, and she was fine with it. I can see what a previous reviewer said about subtraction being a problem by covering the second number with the picture, though. But so far, she's enjoying her success, enjoying putting the pieces together, and feeling very smart indeed. The pieces are made of strong cardboard, which should be durable enough to last until she is no longer interested. I think this might be too easy for a five or six year old, though, and the recommended age is up to age 6.

review/summary: Great Learning Game for Varying Levels of Ability
review/text: My son enjoys this game very much. It requires you to find objects that match specific shapes and numerals, and it offers beginning addition and subtraction as well. Children know they've got the right answer when the puzzle pieces match up, which is really fun. The reason I gave it four stars instead of five is because the subtraction part of the game has the potential to be confusing. For example, on one puzzle piece it shows three apples with a number 3 below it, a minus sign, and then one apple with a number 1 below it. While you and I know that three minus one is 2, when I presented this to my son, he covered the one apple that was after the minus sign, looked at the initial three apples, and said "three." If your child has a problem with this as well, I recommend using real food or household objects (e.g. apples, markers, spoons, crayons) to teach subtraction. Then, when you present three objects and ask your child how many there are when they take away one, they can clearly see there are only two left.

review/summary: Excellent perspective on communal living and human nature
review/text: Ironically, I grew up in a small town close to The Farm, but never knew much about it. A friend asked me about it, and when forced to confront my ignorance on the subject I purchased the book to correct that shortcoming. Little did I know how much I was about to be entertained!Voices from The Farm is written--as a book on the communal living experience should be--by a number of the folks who participated. It is a collection of stories that together summarize the experience of the members, and the life-cycle of the community.The Farm and its various off-shoots accomplished some great humanitarian feats in the face of the suspicion and prejudice of its neighbors. Winning over those neighbors provides some of the most entertaining tales in the book. However, the biggest obstacles seem--as with human society in general--to be rooted in the human nature of the members of The Farm community.This book is a great, entertaining collection of stories that together tell the tale of a marvelous exercise in social science and community economics. Excellent work by the editors in preserving, selecting, and arranging the individual contributions to tell the story of The Farm.

review/summary: Intense memoir told in brief segments by former members of The Farm
review/text: This book gave me a glimpse at life on The Farm, as described by people who'd actually lived there. While no book can EVER be a substitute for the daily reality of living on the land, trying to build a community, take care of children, raise food and get through cold winters, reading this book was still a very powerful experience. It made me think about my spiritual values and what it must have been like for those who were trying to live with a commitment to living gently on the earth, not hurting wild creatures, not using leather.I appreciated the honesty as well - as varous people would talk of giving into corruption and sneaking Dr. Pepper soda on a trip to town and other acts that went against general group values. Some of these values, of course were not overtly stated...but most were understood. Others were in a state of transition.Ultimately, the Farm broke up but this book is a powerfl reminder of all that was good about it and of the yearning for finding new ways of building stronger community lives. I have no way of knowing for sure, but I have a feeling many members of The Farm continue to live with similar values as they had back then, when they were simply thought of as crazy "hippies".

review/summary: awesome book about group dynamics of any kind
review/text: This book is a collection of oral histories and some original documents from the early days of the famous Farm commune in Tennessee. The Farm had a fairly hierarchical structure compared to some hippie efforts, and identified as a spiritual community, with a large amount of group effort and work involved in basic infrastructure, social experiments, and, eventually, charity projects that were difficult for the cash-strapped group to support (like maintaining an ambulance service in besieged Bronx neighborhoods, hundreds of miles from the Farm home base in Tennessee, as well as projects in Central America during a guerrilla war that threatens local partners in the project).The stories are a FANTASTIC look at group dynamics and, in my opinion, give a great look at the consequences of the "mission creep" that idealistic projects such as nonprofits and religious organizations are prone to. Much of this is very entertaining, often in a black-humor sort of way, and gives a great look at commonalities in human nature that apply today, whether to today's version of 'hippies', or any hard-working and idealistic group of humans trying to better the world.

review/summary: A Good Look at the Culture of Assyrians and Israelites
review/text: I was introduced to this book when I was a teenager. I loved it then, and was pleasantly surprised to see it still available. Reading it again to my own children, it was better than I remembered, and loved by all of them, from ages 6 to 14. Although at times the heroine is presented as almost too good to be true, the plot of the book is exciting, and left my children asking me to read one more chapter. The setting of the book provides a great amount of historical detail, leaving the reader with an excellent understanding of the Israelites' constant fear of raiding and invasion by the Assyrians, and a good grasp of daily life in Assyria. The book takes a few unexpected twists and turns, and has enough unanswered questions throughout to keep readers of all ages interested. All in all, a very good choice to help understand this time period.

review/summary: The Battleship Bismarck reviewed
review/text: This book is both a history and a photo album of the famous German battleship, and the photos are particularly useful in showing both the construction stages of the ship and for the many interior shots. That said, this book has a couple of problems. One is its age; it was originally published in 1975, and the authors appear not to have taken advantage of the information that appears in Ludovic Kennedy's "Pursuit," published the previous year. As a result, there are statements in this book, particularly concerning the Bismarck's chronology, that have been disproved by more recent discoveries. The other big problem is the translation, which appears to have been done very literally by someone with little knowledge of naval nomenclature. Thus, "Seekriegsleitung" gets translated as "sea-war-leadership," which may be a literal translation, but ignores the more generic term "naval operations," which is what this really means. This problem becomes particularly aggravating in trying to follow the time-line of events surrounding the destruction of the Hood and the Bismarck, which, as translated, make almost no sense. The diagrams, which are in German and are not translated, seem fairly accurate, although during the destruction of the Bismarck they appear to show the King George V firing torpedos at the Bismarck, when in fact the King George V had no torpedo tubes. It's also puzzling that the translator, according to the note at the end of the book, was unaware until 1989, with the publication of Robert Ballard's book on the discovery of the Bismarck, of the number of German sailors rescued after the sinking of the Bismarck. Even here, his figures are wrong--he states that 115 men were rescued by the British. In fact, British warships rescued 111 men (one later died and was buried at sea) while a German submarine and a German weather ship rescued the other five. A marginally useful book, although much of its information has been supersceded by more recent discoveries and research.

They are just the right weight of fabric for those cool winter mornings in Southern California (not so for 85degree summer days, when I'll stash them away for cooler days to come). My size is somewhere between a medium and a large. These adidas pants are amply cut, but maybe a tad too roomy for my particular build. A medium would probably be restrictive when I'm doing calesthenics or some weight exercises. This being said, I am nevertheless very happy with this product and with Amazon's superior service.

review/summary: NOW... That's what I Call Electro-rock
review/text: Practically ignored by music criticism (even by indie critics), this record really makes everything DFA has produced sound like crap (by the way, I love DFA)... Soulwax has always been a rock band as oposed to their alias "2 many djs" that is used for electronic work, remixing and DJing. But this record takes the better of both names, Soulwax remixed (or re-created) their own songs and if that was not enough they open the album with an amazing rock cover of Daft Punks's "Teachers". 2manyDJS has also been known for their bastard pop tracks, and they do it here too in songs like "NY Lips" (sampling Funky town in a much more "funky" way than the original)... Potent beats and basslines are heard all over the songs, samples and lyrics are funny and fascinating.My humble advice: buy this record... now!

review/summary: Nite Or Day, You Are The One
review/text: In lieu of a new studio album, Soulwax have done the increasingly common thing and released a remix record to quench the public's thirst for new material. Remix releases can be nasty, barrel scraping affairs (just look at the recent Le Tigre compilation for proof), but in light of the critical hiding Any Minute Now copped upon its release in 2004, it's interesting to note the favourable attention Soulwax have attracted since NY Excuse was released earlier in the year in remixed form. Although that radio-friendly track doesn't make it to Nite Versions, there's two other versions of NY Excuse on offer, with NY Lipps incorporating a smattering of Lipps, Inc's classic disco cheese Funky Town to groovy effect. While second version Another Excuse is a DFA and Soulwax collaboration, sadly the gathering of minds looks better on paper than it sounds in reality, ensuring NY Lipps and its pots and pans percussion make for the better NY Excuse remix. Elsewhere on Nite Versions Soulwax's Dewaele brothers cover Daft Punk on album opener Teachers, completely reinvent E Talking save for a bassline and add an air of volatility to Compute via the use of a harpsichord.As proven by their 2 Many DJs sideline, the Dewaeles know their way around a mix disc, with Nite Versions sampling LA Style's James Brown Is Dead on I Love Techno, adding Ultravox-style flourishes to Accidents And Compliments and seguing tracks with a perfect fusion.Next up is their production role with Canada's Tiga, but for now Nite Versions satisfactorily keeps the interest in the Belgians high.

Anyway, I'd heard of this album but never paid too close attention to it. I had no idea what I'd been missing. HOLY SH!T am I impressed, this is exactly whats been missing for the past couple years. I've been waiting for this for so long, yet here it was this whole time. From beginning to end this CD grabs hold & doesn't let go, simply amazing music from start to finish. Do all yourselves a favor and buy this CD, it's finally available domestically, there's no reason not to own it. You'll thank me later.

review/summary: Why is SOULWAX ignored by critics & consumers alike?!
review/text: I just don't get it - SOULWAX has been around since the 90s, when they released their "rock" debut (on the now defunct Almo Sounds), chock full of should-have-been radio hits, and then when while they got some attention for their "2 Many DJs" mash-up/remix bootlegs, when they return to a full-fledged band, as with last year's ANY MINUTE NOW, critcs & consumers alike barely took notice of that album's amazing writing, production, and sheer electro-rock power. Hopefully, "Nite Versions" (a cheeky title recalling when 80s bands like Duran Duran used to release "Nite Version" on 12" of singles for clubs) will garner more sales and attention for SOULWAX - the songs practically leap out of the speakers to grab your neck and turn you head and make you move. Can't wait to hear what they do TIGA on his upcoming "Sexor" debut...?

review/summary: cheesy, very dated, and well... the beginning of a great career
review/text: I don't know exactly when Jason Bateman started his career, but after watching Arrested Development the last several years (reruns of course) I wanted to tune into Moving Target to find out what he looked like as a teenager. WOW, haha. He looks pretty much the same as he does now, except he's much smaller, and I THINK I remember Jason Bateman being somewhat of a chick magnet for all the teenage girls out there back in the late 80's.Anyway, while I didn't expect Arrested Development-type quality while watching Moving Target (or a comedy for that matter) I can't say this movie does a whole lot of things differently from all the other similar "run from bad guys- shoot bad guys" movies that are out there.The only difference in this film compared to the many similar ones from the same time period is that Bateman plays a teenage boy in this movie as the main character, and he has to run from the bad guy that supposedly has connections to the mob and forces Bateman's parents to change their names and where they live. Why didn't the parents tell Bateman about any of this and instead waited for him to return home from summer camp to find out his parents no longer lived there, so Bateman's character has to be worried sick and constantly confused? I have no idea. Maybe a case of bad parenting. Actually I think it's because Bateman chose to skip summer camp and he ran away early to return home. Maybe the parents WERE planning to tell him when he arrived home.Anyway, it's somewhat cheesy as far as the acting is concerned, but because it's an older film there's something somewhat appealing about the occasional sloppy writing and acting skills. I liked it. Bateman went on to much much MUCH better things (such as Arrested Development) but this movie ain't bad for what it is.

review/text: 2 stars of 5 for this slow dull "classical" 1980's style movie. This movie has a young Jason Bateman in the lead. Very very very slow and dull with a few moments of bad 1980's style music. To our relief the background music (which is very annoying) is kept to a minimum. Though it attempts to be an action/suspense movie, it achieves neither. I'd suggest skipping this movie.

review/text: This little book is one of the most important works I have read in my 50+ years. With simple, yet incredibly powerful ideas, it challenged me to get &quot;out of my philosophical box&quot; and think again about life, God, and how it all works together. Recalling the simple statement Jesus made, that we &quot;must become like little children...&quot;, I played along with the exercises outlined in the book and found an earth-shaking change taking place in my life.

review/summary: CLEAR AND INSPIRING EXPLANATION OF SPIRITUAL TREATMENT
review/text: Dr Baker explains clearly and engagingly how one can improve one's life by changing your subconscious pattern through the spiritual technique called treatment. The essence of treatment is this: When the conscious mind of the individual deliberately selects a creative idea and delivers that idea to the subconscious, the subconscious mind acts as a law and proceeds to produce the equivalent of that idea in the individual's experience. The subconscious mind is the producer of one's experience, while the conscious mind is the decider of experience. Both phases of mind are spiritual processes working together - they are the God process in the individual. This wonderful work provides a spiritual technique for richer living. Chapters deal with, inter alia, Happiness, Wealth, Love, Success and Freedom, and includes helpful affirmations and prayers. On a par with the work of Joseph Murphy, Catherine ponder and Florence Scovel-Shinn, this book should be read repeatedly to provide the maximum benefit.

review/text: Dr. Barker opened the First Church of Religious Science in New York City in 1946, was President of the International New Thought Alliance and a well-known minister, author and teacher throughout the New Thought movement. This classic book is often used in Religious Science classes. Dr. Barker explains how to change the subconscious pattern through spiritual treatment. Some of his statements: There are unfortunately a great many people with attractive surface attitudes but with the same old rubbish underneath (9), If you fail to direct your subconscious mind, it produces under a law of averages, and you are a nice, ineffective sweet person (84), I call treatment mind surgery. It is the way in which you go into the subconscious, destroy old patterns and instill new ones (90).

review/summary: Good help for the willing
review/text: Raymond Charles Barker believes in metaphysics, but you need not share his views on such a weighty topic to derive benefit from this book. Treat Yourself to Life is a manual for productive living -- a self-help book you might say -- and Barker provides a straight-forward approach for getting what you want in terms of love, wealth, health and self-expression.Skeptics may cringe at the author's faith in the individual to create his own destiny through the book's teaching, but Barker responds by urging the reader to assess the merits of the teaching based on real results for the individual.The books divides into chapters on Happiness, Wealth, Love, This Day, Success, Freedom and Life, and offers a method to improve one's experience with regard to each. Barker demands faith and effort, but at its core, the method really does not differ much from techniques in cognitive therapy and sqaures with the latest views on neuroplasticity, at least in my view. Yet the teaching seems more positive and offers a greater faith in human nature. Surely, the reader will have to decide for himself.

review/summary: Harnessing thought-power
review/text: Dr Baker was one of those great 20th century metaphysicians like Emmet Fox, Ernest Holmes &Thomas Troward, who understood the working of the mind long before psychotherapy became popular. This approach is called "the religion of healthy mindedness" by William James in his classicThe Varieties of Religious Experience.Barker explains clearly and engagingly how to improve one's life by changing your subconscious pattern through the spiritual technique called `treatment.' The essence of treatment is this: When the conscious mind of the individual deliberately selects a creative idea and delivers that idea to the subconscious, the subconscious mind acts as a law and proceeds to produce the equivalent of that idea in the individual's experience.

review/summary: Highly recommended
review/text: Security specialist Micah Lassiter finds himself in an ethical quandary when wealthy businessman Alan Street hires him to protect his daughter, and Micah quickly finds his heart becoming involved. Allen owns one of the most successful software companies in the world, which now has made him the target of threats. The man sending threatening letters is obviously brilliant, unbalanced and dangerous. Concerned for his daughter, Alan wants someone to keep an eye on Prudence night and day to ensure her safety. But Micah must protect Prudence without her knowledge. She has struggled hard to establish her independence from her father and won't welcome his intrusion now, however well meaning.Micah moves into the apartment across the hall from Prudence, using his proximity to arrange quiet dinners and intimate moments. By necessity, Prudence believes he's courting her, and is confused by his mixed signal when he kisses her on one day and then emotionally distances himself the next. Micah is equally confused by his reactions, knowing that emotional involvement can endanger her safety. Prudence becomes the cause of some real soul searching, as their relationship takes a path he didn't expect. As danger escalates, Micah finds not just her life in danger, but his heart. Further, she won't be tolerant when she finds out her father hired him.Ruth Langan deftly combines danger and romance in BY HONOR BOUND. Langan has a gift for creating wonderful characters. The direct confrontation of the ethical issues provides striking characterizations with believable dilemmas. Her secondary characters likewise sparkle, from the Lassiter family to the meddlesome sisters that live in the same apartment building as Alan and Prudence. Unexpectedly delightful, BY HONOR BOUND comes highly recommended.

review/summary: Map your Imagination
review/text: It's pretty cool looking at one of these maps that started out as satellite photos and then were filled in with cartographic caricatures (with prime features exaggerated out of scale). You are musing "wow, I didn't know that was out there," and pretty soon you're in the car heading out to see something that no one you know ever heard of. I found something on this map out in the vastness of Kansas called the Chalk Hills, looked it up, it's all on private land but apparently the owners don't mind, there are no fences visible and no other tourists, and there are these natural wonders for you to grok at.http://www.kansasphototour.com/chalk.htmhttp://www.kansasphototour.com/castle.htmhttp://www.ourks.com/chalkpyramids.htmlI have one of these in my own backyard, the Sutter Butteshttp://www.middlemountain.org/picture.htmin the upper part of the Central Valley of California.It is normally invisible in Sacramento because of either smog or agricultural dust. I had never seen it, one day it rained and I saw this magic mountain rising out of the plain. I went to bed, had a dream about it, got up out of my sleep and had to drive there. (Unfortunately, the locals glare at you because of all the bad tourists, and this one is fenced, with some places with weird manhole covers and red-&-white striped antennas sticking up out of the ground.)

review/summary: Smartly done
review/text: Due to the time-lag up to the present (5-9 years after the original publication) it needs to be pointed out that some of the essays may have lost shreds from their novelty; while others, like Al Hidell's charting out the EuroAtlantic grand chessplayers' ulterior geostrategical motives (among them g.o.d.= guns, oil/pipelines, drugs) leading up to the violent breakup of Yugoslavia and to the birth of their latest stepchild, say, in the form of Kosovo, are timelier than ever. Just as Israeli connections (far from being the whole picture) to the 9-11 inside job (& the rest), in another offering from the same author/co-editor, cannot be repeated often enough either.Aside from the articles already referred to in the above editorial review, further titles are as follows:Joan d'Arc: Giordano Bruno: 16th-century ufologist?; The Aviary and the Eschaton: an interview with 'Chicken Little'; Marcel Vogel and the secret of the fifth force; w. Frank Berube: Declaring war on the human spirit: the media spectacle vs. the collective psyche. (Sidebar: Worthwhile to note at this juncture that the historical personage Jeanne d'Arc, whose name the contributing author/co-editor borrowed as her nom de guerre, may not have been burnt alive but lived to the age of 57 as Margarita d'Champdiver, daughter of king Charles VI and his mistress Odetta d'Champdiver. See in David McGowan's "Programmed to Kill. The Politics of Serial Murder" (2004, p. 344 fn. 50) citing a Pravda report dated 01/27/2004.)Frank Berube: The Third Reich of Dreams: Charlotte Beradt's "Diaries of the Night".

review/summary: Great advice on caring for your Birman
review/text: I bought this to help understand care issues specific to the Birman breed, and it really helped. The section on exhibition was interesting, but not really relevant to my needs. It was great to have sections on feeding, grooming, temperament, and health that were tailored specifically to the Birman, since this breed of cat is very unique. It goes into detail on health issues of the Birman such as the breed's propensity for kidney disease and the importance of annual blood work. The book also talks about the gentle nature of this cat and how it needs the companionship of humans much more than other breeds and how easily a Birman can get its feelings hurt and even pout. Grooming tips are given on how to take care of the thick yet fine coat of the Birman. I've found it to be the best book on cat care out there for the Birman and I highly recommend it.

review/summary: My new favorite book from the Avon True Romance series.
review/text: Tess was washed ashore on the Isle of May during a terrible storm eleven years ago, presumed to be the only survivor of a shipwreck. Just six years old at the time, Tess had buried horrible memories deep within her, and remembered little of what brought her to the island. An elderly couple living on the island raised her and taught her to be self-sufficient. But now they are dead, and Tess is all alone on the island. She longs for human companionship but has learned to fear the world beyond the Isle of May. When a young Highlander washes ashore in a storm, Tess feels compelled to save him. At twenty years of age, Colin Macpherson is the youngest son of a Highland laird. He's been restlessly roaming the seas, but when he washes up on Tess's island, everything changes. As Colin helps Tess remember her past, he finds himself drawn to her as he's never been drawn to a woman before. And Tess is discovering strong feelings for him as well, feelings that may very well be love. But when they return to the mainland in search of Tess's heritage, will they be able to stay together, or will they be torn apart?Set in Scotland in 1543, this is my new favorite book in the Avon True Romance series. The love story between Tess and Colin was so romantic and incredibly sweet, and I LOVED the setting. If you are a fan of the Avon True Romance series, or like historical romances for teens, this book is a must-read.

review/summary: An awesome novel from May McGoldrick
review/text: After enjoying a previous Avon True Romance, Gwyneth and the Thief, I decided to read more from the series. I thought Gwyneth was great, but this is even better yet. Tess is a seventeen-year-old who lives on the Isle of May. She was taken under the care of a couple who oversaw the island, but they have died, and she is completely alone. One day, she finds that a young man is washed ashore, and drags him from the water. She does not want to be near him, as she was warned to stay away from all men, so she hides on the island. Colin Macpherson, a highlander, searches for the young lady who rescued him. Tess is stubborn, but eventually they get to know one another. Tess does not know much about her past, with the exception of nightmares which give small recollections. Colin realizes that Tess is part of the Lindsay clan, and when a ship comes to rescue him from the island, Tess goes with him, in order to find the life she was taken away from eleven years ago. Will she be able to have peace, and be with Colin, the person she has grown to love? Read this very interesting novel to find out. I really enjoyed reading this. Many congratulations to May McGoldrick on writing such a great novel!

With no memory of the life before then, she stays with the old caretakers of the isle. After the caretakers are dead a young man, Colin Macpherson washes up on shore. Colin takes Tess back with her to his castle where he helps her uncover her past. They are opposites,but you know what they say opposites attract. This book is just one of many in the Avon True Romance series. I have read every book in the series and I know that if you like this book you love the rest. This is a great book for girls about 10 to 16 because it is still a romance novel, but not what you call a trashy romance novel. It is a great novel fokr those who are just getting into romance novels.

review/text: Tess Lindsey has lived on the remote island of Isle of May and has been raised by the only two other people who lived on the island, all the time uncertain of who she is and her true identity. After the death of her caretakers, she is left on the island all by herself and must do battle alone. That is until one day she rescues a stranger---a stranger who also holds her questions of her past in his very hands. Colin MacPherson has the knack for adventure and a beautiful girl at every single place he visits, that is until he meets Tess...a strong-willed girl that intrigues him at every turn. As the two form a bonding trust Colin begins to piece together the clues of Tess's mysterious past...and a future that most likely will not include him. This definitely has to be one of the best Avon True Romances so far, after Anna and the Duke. I didn't expect it to be this good so it really took me by surprise. Every teenage girl who loves romance should read this book!

review/text: The plot and outline was good, just the writing needed a bit of work. Things were repeated over and over through out the story and became redundant. Talk of children playing with dogs and such. Also there wasn't a good transition in Tess's attitude. She is weepy and scared, but when she gets there she is couragous, makes a speech and confronts a steward? This was okay, but other Avon True Romance books are better. Nicola and the Viscount, and Anna and the Duke being my favorites.

review/summary: good romance for teens
review/text: Tess is alone. For eleven years, an elderly couple raised her after finding her at six, alone and frightened, amongst the rocks on the shoreline of the island they keep. Now, though, Tess' guardians have died, leaving Tess to tend to the island and, as per their orders, hide whenever someone new comes there. When she finds a handsome young Highlander washed up on the shores of her island, she knows she must help him or he will die.As Tess and the handsome Highlander, Colin, spend time together waiting for a ship to come take him home, they form a friendship and discover that Tess is not so alone in the world as she thinks.This was a cute story, and definitely better than the last Avon True Romance (for teens) I picked up. It's the type of thing I would have swooned over as a teenager, had I deigned to read romances at that age (I admit, I had a bit of book snobbery going on, though I secretly loved any romance I could find in books I read). As an adult, now, I read the book and think it's cute. I would have loved to have seen how Tess and Colin's relationship matures as they do, but that is beyond the scope of this book and the age range it is intended for. I will probably be searching out McGoldrick's adult romance novels, though, given the promise this one held.

review/text: Tess Lindsay is content to be the sole occupant of a remote island but when Colin Macpherson washes ashore her life of solitude gets shaken up. Tess had always been told to fear strange men but she reluctantly strikes up a friendship with Colin. Soon Tess discovers that she has a family she had forgotten about but will she have the courage to leave the island and start a new life?The beginning of this book is very amusing and the end is decent too but the middle is a big problem. The plot loses much of it's believability mostly due to the poor characterization. All of the new characters that are introduced are one sided and their behavior lacks reason. Even Tess and Colin's development is side tracked in much the same way and their relationship seems awkward and forced. The writing does improve towards the end but it's not enough to save the book.

They are pretty decent pants but just one addition would make these pants a five,if they added the adjustable waist band feature that most of the pants her size have(the one with stretch and a button inside the waist band). Other than this one suggestion they wash and wear well.

review/summary: Top class CD, but a little too long
review/text: Coming at this CD as a complete novice to Drum and Bass music, it was totally mind blowing. At last a band that could use the techniques to make a complete album. The music mixes up a variety of dance and jazz to produce a superb sound, that is both good for listening and dancing to. Kelly, the lead singer, has one of the best female voices I have heard. Her voice is both passionate and soft, but she brings a down to earth feel to every word.Unfortunately the Album is too long and like many Drum and Bass (or Dance) albums there are, as call them, filler tracks, beats and sounds that could have been used to make a complete tune. These filler tracks sound like overlong intros. I have resorted to writing down the tracks I want to listen too, so I can program my cd player.The Album moves on from their earlier stuff and produces a new style of sound with a retro feel.However no matter how many filler tracks are on this album it is definaitely worth having.Well done to E-Z rollers, look forward to the next album

review/text: This is my first encounter with Yoruba and I have to say that CDs are really helping. However, the book is very short and not particular about certain aspects and details of grammar and other nuances - for someone who NEVER spoke Yoruba and doesn't have anybody to ask for a clue, it leaves a lot of questions unanswered - for this, however, there are hopefully other Yoruba textbooks.On the brighter note, I would like to add that the book does a very good job in giving a little insight on Yoruba people and Yoruba culture in general. I would recommend it as a good start book for anyone who wants to learn Yoruba - you can't go wrong with it.

review/summary: Great starting point
review/text: This book contains a great amount of vocabulary. It teaches you the Anglicized versions of certain words such as "teacher" but it also gives you the Yoruba word. Although I didn't appreciate the Anglicized words at first, they are good to know because a lot of people use them. The CD is an excellent and necessary addition to the book. There are lots of dialogues and lists of vocabulary on them (there are 2 CDs). The CD does skip over some of the exercises in the book, which I guess you're supposed to go over by yourself or with a teacher, though. All in all, it's a great set and, if mastered, can bring the user to a high level of fluency. I also like that the narrator, who speaks English to announce the lessons, is a native speaker and doesn't butcher the names of the characters in the dialogues. There is a Yoruba book/CD set created by another publisher who uses a British narrator. It really throws you off course throughout the CD. Watch out for that one and buy this one instead!

review/text: I agree, the CDs are a much needed help, since it would be impossible to pronnounce the Yoruba tones without the help of a native speaker. However, the design of the book is really poor and confusing. I have found several spealling mistakes in English and Yoruba. And the grammar explanations are very hard to understand.Unfortunately there are not many Teach Yourself Yoruba books that are worth it. This one at least provides basic vocabulary and pronounciation skills.

The companion CDs that come with this book are simply outstanding. I especially enjoy the fact that the book is respectful of ALL religions.As an update after using the CDs for a few weeks, it is true that the speaker who speaks fastest on the CD does make many mistakes. I noted errors on greetings. These are rather odd to say the least. However, I still think this is a great source! My toddler is learning right along with me and she demands I play the CD everyday! As we repeat phrases, I simply correct the errors. I really appreciate the different participants on the CD and the dialogues which are authentic and properly contextualize the vocabulary.The phrase "O'ngbiyanju" is priceless!

review/summary: Super fun!
review/text: This tic-tac-toe take-off is extremely fun. Don't let the "JR" fool you. It is simple enough for my 5YO yet challenging enough for any adult. Each player gets 6 "gobblets" (2 small, 2 med, and 2 lg) to play with. We learned very quickly that part of the strategy is figuring out which size pieces to play first, but it is also important not to just "gobble" each other up since it is easy to gobble to the point where each player has just two spaces on the board. Since "gobbling" is so much fun it is hard to resist over-gobbling.This is a top-notch game, very fun to play. The gameboard and pieces are all wooden and attractively decorated. Even the box is very sturdy. This is a fun and welcome addition to our collection.

review/text: This is an AWESOME game! Almost everyone know tic-tac-toe so it is EASY to learn and quick to play. You can't play just once! The twist is that your pieces are slightly different sizes - just big enough to gobble up your opponent. The first person to make tic-tac-toe wins, but it's not as easy as it looks when you're stuck in the mindset of just making three in a row and forget about the gobbling possibilities! My 4 and 5 year olds will beat me even when I'm trying to win! Excellent beginning critical thinking game. Grandparents loved playing it with the kids too.

review/summary: Fun, simple game but challenging enough for adults
review/text: I like that kids can beat adults at this game. It's like tic tac toe but in an advanced way. It's simple enough that my 4-year-old takes a try with this (not so successfully but with a lot of fun and enthusiasim) and my 7-year-old definitely plays this well. You have to watch your moves carefully because your pieces can be covered by an opponent's piece easily (and with tic-tac-toe you don't get to cover someone's space once they've played on it, so this can be a tricky addition to the game.)Friends introduced us to this game one weekend and within 2 days I ran out and bought it myself. Easy to travel with as well...you can just pile up the pieces in a small bag and leave the wood board at home. When you get where you're going, it's easy to create the board with a piece of paper and pencil (just like a tic tac toe board.)This is a good gift item as well. Not as many people have this at home so it's one you can feel safe in buying and giving to someone as a little something unexpected. We've ordered a few as gifts and have fun teaching the game to others.

It is just like tic-tac-toe, but you can eat up your opponent's pieces with your own larger pieces. It is a game of strategy. My 7 year old enjoys beating her 17 year old cousins in this game, before they figure out how to do it. My 5 year old can beat his cousins as well. I would recommend it.

review/summary: great teaching tool but not a great game
review/text: This is a good pure strategy game but it has one defect that limits it for older players. The Original Gobblet is 4x4 and is a fun complex sophisticated strategy game, but it's also a long game not suited to 6 year olds just getting started in board games. Gobblet Junior looked like great idea when I bought it. 3x3 meant games would end quickly but teach the basic stategy. Perfect for a 6 year old.The problem is that the person who goes first can force the win. This force is not perfectly simple as it not a pre-determined set of moves but is rather like a predetermined set of responses. So if you can memorize chess openings or checker openings then you can always win this game.The good news is that until the child comes to realize this and seek tat solution it is a good game a teaching how to think several moves ahead. it is fun. But eventually one realizes it is a won game and a lot of the fascination is lost. So it's good training for many month, then you need to buy a 4x4.

review/summary: Kelly Club Pet Parade at HIT!! My Daughter Loves IT!!
review/text: My 4 year old daughter LOVES this game. She sings the "Strike Up The Band and Clap Your Hands for Kelly's Pet Parade!" song around the house. She can dress the Kelly kids, "train" each pet (teach the pony to jump, etc.), clean and get the animals ready for the parade (paint the elephant's toe nails, etc.), and decorate the floats...all by herself. She'll get everything ready (showing me everything she has accomplished along the way) and then we'll watch her special parade. A wonderfully cute game that I highly recommend.She can mostly do the entire game on her own. I have it installed on a laptop so she is actually using the inset mouse and can still do the game. The only one she has a tough time with is the Polar Bear catching fish game. It's tricky to move your finger on the mouse pad and click at the same time to catch the fish. It would be much easier using a regular mouse.

review/summary: I was voted "favorite aunt" by my 3-year-old niece!
review/text: Apparently this is about the best $... I have spent lately (aside from the Gameboy game I sent my nephew). My niece is mesmorized by this game, and it is keeping my sister busy building parades. My niece is a little too young to run this program by herself, but she has definitely figured out what button needs to be pushed to make the parade start! My sister also told me that she likes the fact that you can save multiple parades for those days when she just doesn't have time to help create a new one. This seems to be a winner!

review/summary: Fabulous!!!
review/text: After doing alot of researching and reading reviews I purchased Kelly's Pet Parade and it is fabulous.My four year old daughter has has no problems playing it without any supervision. Ability to use the mouse is important.She can keep the different activities as simple or as elaborate as she wants to.When you want to do a new parade you have to use a different name (susie2 etc.) or erase the saved parade.The whole thing is just darling and fun to play. My daughter has to do 30 minutes of a math or alphabet game before she can play Kelly's Pet Parade. So, she likes it so much that using it as a reward has worked.

review/summary: Daughter LOVES this game!
review/text: Lately, my 4 year old daughter has been obsessed with computer games. I'm buying more games on CDs to decrease her exposure to the internet. She loves animals so I figured this would at least be mildly interesting. That turned out to be an understatement. She fell in love with it instantly.There are four characters in the game and each has an animal friend. To play the game, you have to prepare each character and their animal for a pet parade by teaching the animal a trick, picking out clothes for the character, and designing a float for each pair. After each pair and their float is ready for the parade, you have to organize the parade and add special effects. Then, you start the parade and the program plays out the parade that you designed. The parade is actually pretty brief, but it can be played over and over as many times as you like.The game can be quickly mastered by most children but has enough variety to encourage them to go back to repeat the tasks many times. There are a variety of clothing choices and float options. Even though it seems repetitious to me, my daughter doesn't seem to mind it - and she's very advanced with computer use. I've also noticed that when she goes back over and over to play the games where she teaches the animals their tricks for a specific parade, the game increases in difficulty so it's not monotonous. There are also several options for printables, including a cute friendship bracelet with your child's name on it.This game certainly would not qualify as educational, although it does build good computer skills and hand/eye coordination. Overall, I would say it's just good, clean fun.I gave this four stars because sometimes the program seems a little slow and there is a delay between screen changes. Also, you can't play the game without the CD in the disk drive, even after fully loading the game on the computer. This is a negative to me because for most kids, you would have to assist them with starting the game. However, my 4 year old has pretty much mastered inserting the CD, closing the drive drawer, and clicking on the program icon. I'm just not totally comfortable with her doing it when I'm not there. The last thing I need is to have a broken CD jammed in my computer...

review/text: Don't usually purchase shoes without trying them on first and I should have stuck with my rule. They are advertised as a Wide, but actually they didn't feel like it. The quality of the shoe is Wonderful and the shoe is really cute. I think it would be great for the average foot. I'm wondering since they put elastic in the shoe, that's what they considered "wide". Since I wore it once, I probably can't return it. If you have a regular width foot, I'd order this. Cute shoe!

review/summary: Much more sensible than most books critical of the field.
review/text: This is not the first book I've read that is critical of psychiatry. But compared to Caplan, Breggin, and Szasz, this is the most sensible critique I've seen. Usually, in the anti-psychiatry literature one finds inexcusible nonsequiturs. For example: "Psychiatrists often don't realize that the medication is causing the disorder (good point). Therefore, biological psychatry is unsound (bad point)." Or "Psychiatric illnesses are voted on by committee (good point), therefore there is no such thing as mental illness (bad point)." Walker avoids making such obvious nonsequiturs. Far from being against biological psychiatry, Walker argues that current psychiatry is not biological enough. It appeals to highly hypothetical conditions (such as neurotransmitter disorders) while ignoring known conditions (such as pin worms or hypothyroidism). Some might think that this is all that Walker is saying, but his general point seems to be that since psychiatrists are taught to run through symptoms lists instead of being medical detectives, there a lot of unknown conditions which they are failing to discover.

review/summary: Fascinating and Terrifying
review/text: Dr. Walker's book is a stern indictment of the contemporary medical profession and the mental health field in particular. He charges the majority of psychiatrists of ignoring the true needs of their patients and instead practicing and arbitrary pseudo-science of labeling. They seem to have given up on the idea (fundamental to the philosophy of science)that all events have a cause and that to understand something we must understand the process of cause and effect that brought it into being. Most modern psychiatrists are not interested in finding out what is wrong through careful methodology. They are divided into two camps. The psychoanalytic types deny a medical cause for abnormal feelings and behaviour altogether (however, they still want the prestige that comes with being a medical doctor!). They look everything from a bad childhood to alien abductions to explain such things as psychosis and manic depression, even though no scientific study has ever proven the theories on which their claims are based. The next group, the standard issue biopsychiatrists are a little more up to date. They would admit the obvious scientific truth that someone who hears voices or is immobilized by a deep depression is psysically ill. However, they drop the ball as well. Most biologically based psychiatrists give very vague answers about the causes of mental illness, and rely on a few biological treatments which are tried on the patient almost randomly until one seems to &quot;work&quot;. For instance, a depressed person will be given one antidepressant drug after another without the doctor even stopping to consider that the deprssion may result from anemia, a thyroid imbalance, poor nutrition or a host of other causes. Many psyciatric patients today are not even given a blood test, an EEG or any other genuine medical test before traetment is prescribed. Walker points out that until people are given a battery of tests, we will never really know what is wrong with them. Prozac or tranquilizers may make the! m feel better temporatily, but they could be literally dying. He also attacks the concepts of hypochodndria and facetious disorder. For the most part, he argues, these are destructive labels used to protect doctors and stigmatized patients (&quot;if I can't figure out what is wrong with you then it is all in you're head and/or you are just making it up&quot;) While I don't agree with all his points (for instance, his extreme anti-prozac position) I must say that this book is must reading for anyone in need of mental health care.

review/summary: Informative, but left me wanting more
review/text: I was very impressed with A Dose of Sanity because so many books critical of psychiatry remind me of Breggin which claim that there is something &quot;spiritual&quot; missing in the patient, and the author ignores the bioligical problems inherent in the behavioral or mood disorder.However, I as I made my way through the book I was concerned that Dr. Walker was not going to address what to do if you have been diagnosed with a serious mood disorder, but were unable to find a physical cause (like a boy that was ADHD but had cardiac problems). I was right. He never said what to do if you have been diagnosed with manic depression (or any of the other hard to treat mood disorders). He did not address lithium or other non-antidepressant therapies for mood disorders. I agree that these treatments are probably only treating the symptoms of some underlying brain dysfunction that science has not yet named, but what does the patient do until science has figured this out? Remain psychotic? Lithium therapy may be some band-aid solution for a cellular dysfunction of our brain matter, but is a patient supposed to discontinue this medication because science can only offer this treatment to help the symptoms of the disorder? I wish Walker had offered an opinion and information on this issue.Also, along the same line, he didn't say what patients should do once they had gone through exstensive medical testing to determine their problem and nothing physically wrong was found. (Nevermind the fact that he did't give specific tests to ask for - just blood and urinalysis in addition to what else?) If you know that you don't suffer from pin worms, syphillis, typhus, cardiac problems or whatever else, but your symptoms only seem to match typical manic symptoms that only lithium helps, should you throw in the towel and accept the psychotropic medication?I do think that Dr. Walker is truly concerned about patients who have fallen victim to DSM &quot;diagnosis&quot;, and this book could be very helpful for a patient who has received psychiatric care, but did not have a full medical work-up before taking psychotropic medications. I only wish this book had touched on the issues that I mentioned above.Finally, the most important message of this book is never stop learning about what you have been told your disorder is, and never take the word of your doctor as law. As Walker says himself, there is no way that one doctor can know everthing about medicine.

review/summary: Somatic medicine as an alternative to psychiatry?
review/text: Walker's book rests on two main themes. One is that theDSM, in spite of its name, is not a diagnostic manual at all, but a catalogue of descriptive labels that serve as an excuse for abandoning further medical investigation. He calls the DSM "a cookbook listing of symptoms that has replaced the science of differential diagnosis."The other theme divides into two parts. The minor one is that many people who are slapped with DSM labels and prescribed psychotropic drugs have nothing at all medically wrong with them.The major theme, however, and the main theme of the book next to criticism of the DSM, is that almost all cases of serious aberrations of feelings or behavior stem from physical causes such as genetic disease, hormonal imbalances, toxins, infection, parasites, and tumors. The DSM encourages psychiatrists to be lazy and overlook these causes, he says. Psychotropic drugs only mask them, and do more harm than good. Psychotherapy, including psychoanalysis, are totally useless for these conditions. Psychiatry should return to its true mission as practiced (according to Walker) by Emil Kraepelin and Benjamin Rush, namely to identify and treat the physical causes of insanity.I agree with Walker that cases of grossly aberrant behavior (as opposed to responses to stress) are probably due to unidentified physical causes. However, not identifying these causes is the failure of somatic medicine, not psychiatry. Psychiatry's mission has always been to sweep up after somatic medicine, and to sweep away society's rejects while it's at it.Walker maintains that there is a legitimate use of psychotropic drugs, but only in those extremely rare cases that the physical cause cannot be identified, or no curative treatment exists. My opposition to this contention is that far from being extremely rare, those are exactly all cases with which psychiatry deals. One of Walker's examples of physical disease which psychiatrists frequently fail to identify and treat is Tourette Syndrome, which he calls genetic. In spite of his own insistence that the causes of conditions should be scientifically sought, he fails to provide any evidence that TS is genetic in origin. Even if he had such evidence, since when does identifying conditions as genetic make them curable? On the other hand, Walker overlooks compelling evidence that TS is caused by brain damage: it is common in people whose brains have been damaged by psychotropic drugs. He doesn't mention how he thinks TS should be treated. In fact, the only "treatment" that exists, whether effective or not, is Haldol, the very type of treatment he claims to oppose except in those extremely rare cases, whichever they are.While correctly calling into question the efficacy and safety of psychiatric practice, Walker highly overrates somatic medicine. He attaches great diagnostic significance to gene mapping and brain scanning, whereas in reality such toys have as yet benefited no one but the doctors who employ them for research.One of Walker's more bombastic claims for successful treatment of aberrant behavior is ... surgically cleaning cholesterol out of a patient's brain arteries! (Who would be so gullible as to believe that?)Interesting to note are Walker's views on two of the greats among opponents to psychiatry, Peter Breggin and Thomas Szasz.Walker duly credits Breggin with having called attention to the horrific harm done by psychiatric drugs. Unfortunately, according to Walker (and I agree with him on this) the flip side to Breggin is blaming serious dysfunctional behavior on "bad parenting." No, not such obvious bad parenting as battering children or trading them for cocaine, but vague failures that only Breggin himself can identify, like paying insufficient attention to children. Walker might have added that those parents who are likely to seek psychiatric services, not to mention pay big bucks for them (a subject on which Breggin never touches), are the very parents who are deeply devoted to their children. Walker also criticizes Breggin for blaming schools, though schools are very much known to contribute to the ill-being of children.Contrary to his position on Breggin, Walker showers praise on Szasz, particularly for having been the first and the most relentless critic of DSM fake diagnoses. However, he feels Szasz goes too far in denying there is ever a physical origin for dysfunctional behavior, and by suggesting that such people are actually "incompetent, lazy, or bad." He presumes that Szasz would leave them to die in the streets and in jails, overlooking the fact that Szasz is the only writer in the field who has suggested a practical solution for dealing with such people, namely the non-medical asylum, or as Szasz nicknames it, the "adult orphanage."Those of you who are interested in "alternative psychiatry" may be interested in Walker's views on such treatments. He does not reject the idea outright, though he considers most of them quackery and downright silly. Acupuncture he calls effective in treating pain - but not curing the cause of pain.Orthomolecular medicinecan treat nutritional deficiency, but nothing else, he says.Walker further criticizes judges' reliance on psychiatric expertise. He says nothing about it that Szasz hasn't said before him. He does not mention involuntary commitment anywhere in the book.Finally, Walker calls on us, potential psychiatric patients, to take responsibility for our own health care. That's fine advice, but limited by the fact that responsibility can be carried out only in freedom. Massive state intervention in medicine means that much of his otherwise excellent advice is impossible to follow.All in all, this book's power is the author's ability to state in layman's language why theDSMis a fraud.Copyright MeTZelf

The closest thing to another Dr.Walker in Canada might be the ill-fated Dr.Ed Pakes,a brilliant pioneer bereavement psychiatrist. There is also Dr.Robin Brooks-Hill. Then there is an aloof South African &quot;Shrink&quot;,and his son,who wrote some book called &quot;Freud&quot;. (Obviously that isn't really the correct title,but it is a free country) Besides,why see Dr.Aloof Shrink when you can watch Meryl Streep films on Video.

review/summary: The Fabulous Miss Gloria Lynne!!!
review/text: Gloria Lynne has one of the most beautiful and distinct voices I have ever heard. Her voice is as plush as velvet and as sweet as honey. I consider her to be one of the few real divas left from the old school, members of which include Dinah Washington, Ella Fitzgerald, Sarah Vaughn, Nancy Wilson, and Betty Carter (sorry if I may have left out any of your personal favorites).Every song on this album is excellent, along with the jazzy orchestration, which is probably why it was nominated for a Grammy Award in 1990. Gloria gives a freshness to "He's Out Of My Life", almost making it a new song. The mellow sound of "You Keep Turning Me On," is reminiscent of the small jazz clubs where the singer knows many of the audience members by name. The title song "A Time For Love", shows off Gloria's early classical training and withstands the test of time. Her jazzier side is highlighted in the tune "But Beautiful" and "Love Is Blind." Gloria knows how to sing all types of music and her blues like approach to "Trust In Me" is heartwrenching yet warming. Her delivery of "I Thought About You", and "Come Get Your Share" is light and whimsical and makes you feel happy all over. Of course you can't go wrong in ending such a splendid album with the old favorite "I'm In The Mood For Love', and I think after listening to this album we all will be in the mood!!This Album is a winner for me!!!!!

review/summary: Smoldering passionate vocals~Bravo Gloria Lynne!
review/text: "A Time For Love" is clearly time for Gloria Lynne and this superb collection is an inspired musical celebration by an extraordinary singer, Gloria Lynne just gets better as time goes by. "He's Out Of My Life" is magically haunting as Miss Lynne smolders in this timeless classic that sticks with you long after it is over. Finding a funky groove in "You Keep On Turnin' Me On" creates a real cooker while "A Time For Love" becomes a torchy masterpiece and definitive version of the classic from motion picture "Romeo And Juliet". No less than three great self-penned songs show Gloria Lynne is musical through and through with "Lend Me Yesterday" exotic and haunting sounding like a great standard flowing well with other classics in this wondrous set. "But Beautiful" is hauntingly gorgeous and "Trust In Me" is a soulfully sung beautiful version of another timeless classic. Gloria and guitar make "Love Is Blind" a stunning ballad and a jazzy "I Thought About You" is sublime never sounding quite like it does here. The last Gloria Lynne original is a real cooker with Gloria turning "Come Get Your Share" inside out. As in most great works the best is saved for the finale and the stunning "I'm In The Mood For Love" is quite simply glorious. Tremendous collection is a "must have" for anyone who loves The Art Of Great Singing at a sublime peak....get this masterful collection fast while available! Bravo to you Gloria Lynne and your wonderfully gifted and greatly inspired musicans...

review/summary: This music is my addiction
review/text: What can I say? I spend an average of at least fifteen dollars a week playing this game for many reasons. Not only do I get a complete workout, the music just rawks my sawks. That's why I decided I had to throw in my two cents about this CD.I ordered this CD like, a few days ago. I can't wait to get it. This CD is one you can listen to for hours at a time, while never getting tired of the songs. I'm hooked on Dam Dariram and Upside Down [they're also fun to dance to at the arcade], while my friend is hooked to Butterfly, Boom Boom Dollar, and La Senorita. The music... is amazing. This is like, a worthwhile buy for anyone who likes to dance.I've been playing the DDR 3rd Mix Arcade Game for nearly three weeks now, and I haven't gotten tired of the music at all. I'm addicted. The game's fun, but the music's better!I am, as many may know, a rock fan. A lot of people wonder how I ever got into this kind of music, it doesn't fit my 'personality'. Just one listen of this CD will prove you otherwise, it is worth hearing for anyone. Anyone, I bet you, will find something on the CD worth liking.I loved 'So Many Men' because it has this slow beat that I can have fun with. Scott loves 'Butterfly Upswing Mix' because not only does it give you a good workout [on the arcade game], the song is addictive, and you can even sing along, too! 'La Senorita' has that Latin beat that gets your hips moving, and Paranoia infuses your entire body with energy, you have to wonder how can you NOT dance to it.All in all, I HIGHLY recommend this CD to anyone who knows their music, and loves to add a special CD to their collection. I know, for a fact, that this CD will not be leaving my CD player for at least six months... at least.

review/text: This cd is soooo cool. Especially the non-stop megamix the transitions are perfect, but you could be annoyed by the constant voice of the announcer. Some of what he says is very corny but you should be able to live with it (Especially when you're playing the actual game). All in all it's a great CD and a great buy.

review/text: If one were interested in my reviews he would see that the few I have have laid towards the negative. Not the case here. Third Mix is the king of all DDR, with all songs being somewhat speedy and having a good beat (5 or so don't) this soundtrack is tight. This one is actually worth 50.00, forget any other soundtrack.

review/text: I originally purchased this soundtrack from an importer when I heard it was coming out. And I was far from disappointed. It quickly replaced the 2nd Mix soundtrack that hardly left my CD player.This soundtrack collects the songs from the incredibly popular dancing game of the same name. It's huge over in Japan, where they're almost ready to release the 5th mix of the game, and thankfully it's finally finding its own here in the states. The soundtrack features import stars, as well as American type artists like Technotronic and Chumbawumba.And as always, the non-stop mega-mix CD provides a sweet party CD when you don't want to worry about changing the music. Trust me, as far as dance music goes, you won't be disappointed.Now if you excuse me, I have to go listen to my 4th mix soundtrack that just showed up in the mail.

review/text: The songs on DISC 1 are not the full versions, they are the game versions of the songs.You get the whole soundtrack here, PLUS you get hits from 2nd mix as well.Disc 2 is a remix of all the tracks, and they are mixed beautifully. You can put Disc 2 in and have a dance party. They really spent a lot of time mixing the songs. Also, on Disc 2 some songs are longer than the version in the arcade, so you get to hear more of certain songs.I highly recommend this CD to any DDR fan.

I am deeply disappointed as i love the arcade game, but the Dance stage euromix (Dance Dance Revolution equivalent) is lacking in decent tracks, many are jungle-y and are difficult to dance to them.

review/summary: WHAT GREAT NATIONS AND COUNTRY MUSIC IS MADE OF
review/text: Thematically, Letters From Home is similar to Tracy Lawrence's Strong. Both focus on the importance of family, home, and life as it is lived on the human scale over against the larger concerns of the outside world. Neither one claims that the affairs of the world "don't amount up to a hill of beans compared to you and me, baby"; but they do remind in this post-911 world that family and home are what it's all about.Unlike Lawrence, Montgomery is more treasured as "the voice". Vocally, he is more a baritone than a tenor and is more soothing to the ears-a little more "western" and "cowboy" sometimes. Montgomery also is more known for some plainly sentimental songs in the past such as "I Love the Way You Love Me" and "I Can Love You Like That". He has a special attraction, many woman claim, because he can sing tenderly and tug at the heartstrings. This can backfire on any artist because if he does this too often he will soon not be taken seriously. And Montgomery has teetered close to the edge several times in his career.Lawrence's Strong dealt with the refuge of family and home and the dangers that could take it all away. Montgomery chooses to focus more on the human ties that make up this sanctuary.The CD begins with a particularly "southern" interest in "Good Ground". The song runs at a fair clip in country rock fashion. One can wonder at the value of a bunch of dirt beyond what it can do for crops but the singer isn't talking about agriculture. It is about a sense of "place" and how home nurtures life and is the scene where children and families gather the wealth of experience and affection to live life."Letters From Home" (the first single) is a moderately "walking" tune about the things family members say to soldier children who are in dangerous places far away. Sometimes it is when we are afraid we will lose them we finally say what it is we want them to know. It is simple and suggestive-imagine it is a popular but difficult song to hear if you are a soldier or Marine in Afghanistan or Iraq."That's What I'm Talking About" celebrates to joys of a man and a woman. "Look At Me Now" is an object lesson about "I did everything right but I got it all wrong". The song is open to interpretation; but "you see, all that I've done doesn't matter at all/ it's what I leave here when I'm gone" suggests that the family the singer did not have on the path to success was the "pearl of great price" he foolishly did not grasp."Goes Good With Beer" is a little bit of comic relief and every bit the good-timey country tune it sounds like. A song that champions the pleasure of life in a world of trouble, it surely will be an upcoming popular hit."Cool" runs over the same theme as Kenny Chesney's "There Goes My Life" from the viewpoint of a son who doesn't understand why his dad isn't more "with it". Some may complain that it is just an "anti-abortion" song. It is every bit of that; but it is more about a man who holds to honor and obligation rather than the fashion of the day."It Rocked" is the closest Montgomery gets to an outright rock song. Again, it harks back to the country/rock sound of the 1970's; but it swings. Like "That Changes Everything" that follows it, it is about the personal anchors in life that keep us grounded and make life meaningful."Break This Chain" is about getting away from what gets between us and the ones we love. "Little Devil" seems a little out of place except as a light and fun end to some serious stuff. After all, the mild mannered girl the singer wants to skinny dip with in the Jacuzzi could be just a one-night stand for all we know. No one says it's his wife or girlfriend. And the sly little "this can be our little secret/we don't have to tell no one" is undoubtedly suggestive. But this is country music! We can't all be so solemn and dead serious all the time. Besides, some of the best families come out of an indecent skinny dip.Home. Hearth. Family. Sex. These are things that make a great nation. In this case, they also make a great CD.

review/text: I admit that I bought this album for the title track alone. After all, had that been the only good track on this CD I still would have felt that it was worth my money.But the title track is just the beginning for this fine country offering by John Michael Montgomery. I found myself listening to and enjoying every track on LETTERS FROM HOME. Montgomery's smoother-than-silk voice is one of the finest in country music today and his straight-forward approach to his music comes through in every note. You won't want to miss this one.THE HORSEMAN

review/summary: A good, solid country music album!
review/text: John Michael Montgomery has asserted himself as a radio mainstay in the nineties. Though he got little airplay since then--"The Little Girl" is the only hit I can think of--this album promises to deliver him back into the spotlight. He has left behind the twang of his previous efforts, and has chosen a good selection of substantial, well-written and BELIEVEABLE material.LETTERS begins with "Good Ground," an uptempo number about family and love that continues on most of the other songs. The title track is a gut-wrenching number (admit it, you had a tear in your eye when you first heard it) that indeed stands out, but is not the only good tune on here. "Look At Me Now" is a confessional number about growing older, while "Cool" deals with the consequences faced in life."That's What I'm Talkin About" is a romp that manages to skewer gossipers AND contain suggestive lyrics (a similar vein is followed on "Little Devil"). "Goes Good With Beer" is destined to become a honky-tonk classic, while "Break This Chain" is pretty much it's opposite--the story of a man from a long line of alcoholics praying for the strenght to defeat his curse. "That Changes Everything" shows us the surprise directions life can take, while "It Rocked" lets us know that life's greatest moments and sensations come from the simple things.LETTERS FROM HOME is easily John Michael Montgomery's best album. While Montgomery has situated himself as frontman for radio-friendly music (ironically, big-brother Eddie is doing the same thing for outlaw country), he shows us that he does indeed know what a good country song is about...His voice is neither world-class nor run-of-the-mill, but he uses it for all it's worth, and it's worth a pretty penny. LETTERS FROM HOME will make you cry, make you laugh, make you sing, and even--if you're really in the mood--make you dance. A great album by one of today's best performers.

review/summary: Heartfelt &quot;Letters&quot;
review/text: Prime Cuts: Cool, Letters from Home, That Changes EverythingMusically, the family resemblance between John Michael and brother Eddie of Montgomery Gentry fame runs thin. While Eddie Montgomery is a heel kicking honky tonk troubadour, John Michael is the personification of gentility. While Montgomery Gentry has blasted the speakers of country radio with defiant anthems like "She Couldn't Change Me" and "Hell Yeah," big brother Montgomery sings about roping the moon and covering his significant other with kisses.Not surprisingly, nostalgia, sentimentality and introspection earmarked John Michael's latest album "Letters from Home." In fact, other than a few rollicking honky tonk numbers, most of "Letters from Home" deal with the affairs of the heart. Best of which is the excellent title cut as well as lead off single, "Letters from Home." Riding along some gentle guitar picking and plaintive sounding dobro, Montgomery sings about a G.I. savoring correspondence from his parents and loved ones while being far away from home. An engaging number that has done its share of currying favor with country radio, "Letters from Home" finds Montgomery back into the top 10 terrain after a 4 year hiatus. Less poignant, but equally sentimental is the amicable "Look at Me Now."Ultra cool is Harley Allen and Brice Long's ballad "Cool"--- a cautionary tale of a father warning his rebellious teenager to take stock of his rowdy ways for what goes around comes around. Replete with some fine fiddling, Montgomery's performance on "Cool" is nothing less than stellar--sincere, reflective and entrancing. Though "Cool" first appeared on Montgomery's previous greatest hits collection, it's such a standout that I was glad it got revived. Paternal fidelity is also the theme of the album's opener "Good Ground." Though set at a faster tempo with some big booming drums, it's one of the most country efforts Montgomery has tackled in a while.Billy Yates and Jim Collins' "Break This Chain" is another superb country offering. Almost delivered as a prayer, "Break This Chain" expresses the desperate plea of an alcoholic for deliverance for the sake of his family. To my ears, this is one of the most moving tear jerker I have had heard in a while. Nevertheless, not all is sad. The hopeless romantic can put their fainting heart to ease: "That Changes Everything," penned by David Lee and Tony Lane (who were also responsible for crafting the title cut) is a gentle yet beautiful ballad extolling love's power to "change everything."However, not everything works here. Montgomery's sensitivity can work against him when the material is not right. I find Paul Overstreet and Marty Dodson's "It Rocked" excruciatingly sappy. "It Rocked" celebrates the milestones of life: first love, first car, first job.... Come on, I think this is a little too maudlin! I am already starting to get a tooth ache, it's just too sugary. I am sure Montgomery or/and producer Bryon Gallimore must have felt that way too. So, to boost Montgomery's machismo, we have the propulsive honky tonk number "Goes Good With Beer." With Montgomery's crisp free suit and his family man image portrayed in the other songs, I find it hard to believe when Montgomery sings about hanging with his crazy buddies and those "pretty girls" in a smoke filled tavern as he professes in "Goes Good With Beer." A tad more believable is the funky yet somehow raunchy "Little Devil"-though "Little Devil" sounds like a recycle of Montgomery's number 1 hit, "Be My Baby Tonight."Aside from these few detours, "Letters from Home," as the title suggests, appeals to the heart. With country radio's incessant appetite for heart tugging tunes, "Letters from Home" could easily be one of Montgomery's most radio friendly albums. In fact, I believe this album is hued with chart hits. This is a much welcomed return to form for Montgomery.

"goes good with beer" is the type of song that will be a well known sing along if it gets released to radio.

review/summary: One of 2004's best commercial country albums
review/text: Of the flood of post-September 11 patriotic tunes, few have reached the lyrical heights of Alan Jackson's &quot;Where Were You,&quot; and in general most songs in the ouvre have been clumsy and ham-fisted, stuff like Toby Keith's oafish and embarrassingly bad &quot;Courtesy Of The Red, White &amp; Blue&quot; and &quot;American Soldier&quot; or Daryll Worley's catchy but poorly reasoned &quot;Do You Remember,&quot; songs that seek to persuade or score points in the ongoing cultural turf war back on the homefront. In contrast, this album's title track, Tony Lane and David Lee's &quot;Letters From Home,&quot; transcends the politics of the moment with an understated, emotionally resonant, well-crafted portrait of a soldier at war whose crushing daily regime is lightened by news from the folks back home. By not mentioning Saddam or Osama, the song retains a timelessness, speaking to the hardships and determination of soldiers in general, not just those send abroad in the Bush years, and its rise to the top of the charts is quite justly deserved. Though not as powerful as the single, the rest of the album is also pretty good -- on the very next track, Montgomery mentions seeing the war on the evening news, but lapses into escapism and the comfort of baby's arms. On the whole, though, singing one great song with such emotional power ain't bad, and fans who buy this album just on the strength of that track alone will not be disappointed by the rest of the disc.

review/text: Of the flood of post-September 11 patriotic tunes, few have reached the lyrical heights of Alan Jackson's &quot;Where Were You,&quot; and in general most songs in the ouvre have been clumsy and ham-fisted, stuff like Toby Keith's oafish and embarrassingly bad &quot;Courtesy Of The Red, White & Blue&quot; and &quot;American Soldier&quot; or Daryll Worley's catchy but poorly reasoned &quot;Do You Remember,&quot; songs that seek to persuade or score points in the ongoing cultural turf war back on the homefront. In contrast, this album's title track, Tony Lane and David Lee's &quot;Letters From Home,&quot; transcends the politics of the moment with an understated, emotionally resonant, well-crafted portrait of a soldier at war whose crushing daily regime is lightened by news from the folks back home. By not mentioning Saddam or Osama, the song retains a timelessness, speaking to the hardships and determination of soldiers in general, not just those send abroad in the Bush years, and its rise to the top of the charts is quite justly deserved. Though not as powerful as the single, the rest of the album is also pretty good -- on the very next track, Montgomery mentions seeing the war on the evening news, but lapses into escapism and the comfort of baby's arms. On the whole, though, singing one great song with such emotional power ain't bad, and fans who buy this album just on the strength of that track alone will not be disappointed by the rest of the disc.

review/text: Great Toy, hard to find! We get ours online here or shipped from a friend in America!Our little Papillion-Yorkie mix loves it. Every night I am in the back garden kicking the ball for him! He destroys tennis balls by chewing off the fluff and our wee dog finds them to big to carry/catch. We stumbled across this in our local petstore and our dog was hooked! Sadly, local pet store no longer imports them.Stars all around for this one!

review/summary: King James Scores!
review/text: Ryan Jones is a great basketball writer. In King James: The LeBron James Story he does a great job of trying to show the reader how amazingly good LeBron James is at basketball. Coach Bob Gibbons said about LeBron's performance in the Olympic trials, "I don't want to blow too much smoke and distort the kid's thinking, but I saw Kobe Bryant in tenth and eleventh grades, and I think this kid is more advanced than Kobe was." Like LeBron, Kobe Bryant was drafted out of high school and has led the Los Angeles Lakers to multiple NBA Championships.Ryan Jones is editor-in-chief at SLAM, the monthly basketball magazine that combined the sport with hip hop culture at a time when the genre was becoming increasingly popular. The magazine carries advertising for basketball-related products, street-wear clothing and hip hop music, and it has been credited with helping to market hip hop culture and basketball as one. It is only fitting that Ryan Jones wrote his first national magazine feature on LeBron James. He thoroughly explains LeBron's involvement with SLAM magazine throughout the book. He lives in New York with his wife and son.Although Jones seems a bit repetitive at times, his knowledge of basketball and great style shines though and creates an easy to read biography. In Chaper Four, he talks about the potential LeBron possessed in football as well as basketball: even though "there wasn't much national buzz on LeBron the football player, area football coaches knew better." Jones even compares him to the New England Patriots Pro-Bowl wideout, Randy Moss. While he mainly focuses on LeBron's basketball ability, his information about LeBron's high school football career is refreshing.With all the hype about LeBron and his constant coverage on ESPN, this book reveals the truth about LeBron and his journey from moving in with his friend's family to his 90 million dollar sneaker deal with Nike. While the vocabulary can be a bit easy at times, the book a joy to read, especially if you are a total sports nut like myself. A stong strength of Jones is to tell the complete story of every little event in Lebron's life. His very descriptive writing explains aspects of basketball that makes this book a good pick for sports lovers and non sports lovers alike. I give this book an eight out of ten and recommend it highly.

review/summary: KING JAMES is awsome
review/text: My story is about LeBron James and how he grew up. When he was a freshman in high school he won tournament MVP for the state, which is amazing.The beginning starts at his childhood and continues so on. My favorite part in the book is when he's a freshman and he played football. Their team made it to state. They lost in the finals, but he got All State. That means hes one of the best in the state. Later that year he made the basketball team. They made it to the state finals. They won and LeBron got MVP. That happened for the next three years.Ryan Jones is a senior editor at SLAM, the monthly basketball magazine. He lives in New York. I would recommend this book to sports fans that like LeBron James. The age and gender I would recommend this book to is ages 13-35 and boys.

review/text: This was a very cool book. It had a ton of great inside stuff I didn't know about The Man. The sneaker stuff was really interesting. Clearly LeBron was under enormous pressure to perform and to do the right thing, and even with the scounts and everything esle going on he gave 100% to his high school team, The Irish. Jones does a great job taking us inside the making of a star.

review/text: This was a AWESOME book. It really looks into the real life of LEBRON JAMES and shows you his trip into stardom. This book is great if you like watching basketball careers grow because is probably the most popular young basketball players in the world today and this book did a really good job of showing how LEBRON is always improving his game. I have read a ton of sports autiobiographies and this one was probably the most inspiring because it took an indept look at the personal and also basketball part of LEBRON JAMES life.

review/text: King James by Ryan Jones is a biography of Lebron's James' life prior to going into the NBA. It tells about how a little kid who lived in poverty with his mother goes on to become a six foot eight inch 245 pound high school basketball superstar. Lebron has to deal with the pressure of the media and go against tough opponents almost every game. Somehow he is able to handle all of this and all the other obstacles in his life. This is an entertaining book to read and I reccommend it to anyone who is a fan of Lebron James or is interested in reading about the rising star. The author does a great job of telling how Lebron is on and off the court. After reading this book you will come to respect Lebron as a basketbal player and a person.

review/summary: The Truth on King James!
review/text: I first heard about Lebron when he was on the cover of Sports Illustrated and followed him ever since. I thought I read a lot about him, but reading this book told me so much that I had never known about Lebron as a player, a person, and all the hype and attention he got from the media, the shoe companies and everyone else. The fact that he dealt with so many distractions and people hating on him and still succeeded was really inspirational. This book has tons of info and quotes from Lebron, and it shows that he seems like a cool guy, too. I would definitely recommend this book if you're a fan of Lebron or just a fan of basketball and sports in general.

review/summary: Yo Homie this is my sweet review
review/text: LeBron James is a basketball hero. He has a big story on how he got to the NBA. LeBron was very poor growing up; his father left him and his mother when he was young. LeBron had to live with friends so his mom could work to keep a roof over their heads. A cool thing I thought LeBron did is when he was signing autographs an adult pushed over a kid just to get LeBrons signature but LeBron said "Let me sign the kids first". I think this shows LeBrons care for kids.When LeBron was in High School at St.Vincent St.Mary, the spotlight was on him. LeBron took the Irish to the state championship all four years of High School. LeBron played Football and Basketball in High School. He could of gone to college to be a star Wide Receiver but he chose Basketball. LeBron won the Mr.Basketball in Ohio award all four years in High School. I loved this book because LeBron never gave up at what he wanted to accomplish. LeaBron is a great role model to young kids because he never gave up and told himself that he could do it. LeBron now is in the NBA and won the Rookie of the Year award.Written by Gerald P. Willamspoon

review/summary: This is an excellent book
review/text: While this book captures the hip sensibilities of SLAM, it's objective is not to be cool. The objective was clearly to tell LeBron James story, and the author does so fluidly and intelligently. The only issue I had when it came out was if LeBron warranted an entire book. Given that he's spent the first three quarters of his rookie season proving he may have even be underrated, consider the book warranted. So, basketball fans, if you want to know the real LeBron James story before it gets changed or distorted by the corporations that are soon to be even more involved in his life, check out this book and you'll get all the background you need to be able to intelligently discuss the first superstar of the new millenium.

review/summary: Overall a very good read
review/text: This was quite an enjoyable read. I was fascinated by the rise and rise of this basketball prodigy due to all the hype surrounding him. There is no doubt that Lebron James is one hell of a talent after seeing many of his highlight plays on T.V, and on the net. This book details his performances in school for ST Vincent-ST Mary and other events, the frenzied interest from fans and media wanting to see him perform, sport commentators and coaches raving about him being the best thing in the sport of basketball, hummergate, speculation about his future career plans, and the fight for his feet between Adidas and Nike in which the latter won because the former could not offer huge amounts of money in the bidding war with its major rival. Great stuff.

review/text: I have to admit that this is a book I never would have thought to purchase given that it would mean reading the bio of an 18 year old kid!!! Still, it was a gift and I have to say that I was very surprised.The book is short (under 200 pgs) and is an easy read. However, I found that a lot of the book read like a magazine article, given that the author usually writes for Slam magazine, this is no surprise. Still, it is interesting and entertaining. I would recommend for fans of Lebron, high school ball, or die-hard hoops fans.

review/text: This cereal is so sweet....yet so good for you! One taste=ADDICTION!!!! I just tried this cereal out of curiousity and I was hooked! It is an excellent breakfast choice, or just any time to eat! Especially as breakfast because you will crave more honey taste and you won't be hungry later {probably because of how much you'd eat} and it is actually sweeter and better than Honey Bunches of Oats. Cap'n Crunch Berries is an option, but this splendid cereal is SO FILLED WITH A HONEY-FILLED TASTE! I have not tried much better tasting cereal than this! Oh!

review/text: Man I love Oh's cereal. It is really great to the last bite, but the size of the box its so small compared to all the other cereals out there. The price is crazy for such a small box...but oh's is one of the best cereals I have ever ever eaten. It keeps me coming back despite the small box, and crazy price. If you never had it you should try it just once. It is wonderful I give it 3 stars only because of the price and how much food you get. If the portions were more fair even for this price it would be five star gold...

review/text: Oh yes. This cereal is delicious. It's O-shaped corn pieces with "good things in the middle", like real oatmeal. This is a Quaker product, after all. The caramel-like taste, which I'd compare to Cap'n Crunch or old school Mr T, Gremlins and Batman cereal, is sweetened with honey, graham (cracker) flour and brown sugar.It's not a good-tasting but a great-tasting cereal, easily one of the best I've ever tried. But; get this; it's too crunchy. No, it wont get soggy in milk, at-least not in any reasonable amount of time, but that's the problem because it makes for a hard chew. If it had the texture and consistency of, say, Cheerios, it'd be perfect.marcellee.com

review/text: The 5 stars is based on 1)the taste which is amazing and 2) the price which is $1.99.HOWEVER there is much to dislike in OH's. They are NOT healthy, in fact they are the only cereal I've seen made with hydrogenated vegetable oil which is basically margarine. The lard will coat your spoon and roof of your mouth and probably arteries with a white oily film that does not rinse off with water alone. It must be diluted in soap and scrubbed.It is captain crunch shaped in a ring with bits in the middle and somehow sweeter and rougher on your mouth. Oh's virgins WILL have bloody pallates if not careful.

review/summary: Great Book...early work on Timber Framing
review/text: This book is one of the classics on Timber Framing for those who want to get into this type of construction or build their own house. It is a very easy read. Though sometimes the author tends towards to much philosophy about life, construction and wood working.This book has very useful sections on joinery, design, raising, engineering, load physics, etc. Very easy to understand even if, like me, you are not a professional carpenter, contractor or mechanical engineer. I know nothing of contracting or building and understood the whole book.The book does not mention anything about Scribe Rule and Square Rule techniques and the differences between the two. These old techniques may not have been widely known when this book was written, although they were well known by early timber frame carpenters, before Timber Framing was replaced with cheaper, but faster Balloon Framing.A book that does go into Square Rule in a more structured way and is equally easy to read is Buid a Classic Timber-Framed House, by Jack Sobon.

review/summary: Nearly three decades old and more relevant than ever
review/text: This book was first written in 1980, though the philosophies presented between its covers are appropriate in these recent years of speculative energy prices and wobbling economic foundations. Timber frame house construction was "green" before that word was media-masticated and spit into popular culture.The book is well illustrated and instructive, and it is also well written. The authors have both experience and passion for this topic. The hand-drawn illustrations are well labeled with a drafting font that makes it interesting and captivating to read.The book begins with a historical review of this art, and slowly drills down to detailed diagrams of the many joining techniques. It is amazing that this old style of construction intuitively solved problems in structural mechanics without the need for finite element modeling, or even nails for that matter. The strength of this method of construction comes not from the size of the timbers (though they are substantial), but from the joints crafted from wood with axes, augers, and hammers. Timber framing is like cabinet building, but bigger.There are many detailed drawings of joining techniques, and the reader quickly realizes that the craftsmanship and careful execution of these joints is the secret to this respected building trade. Flipping through these pages also immediately reveals the compromises that are made in modern home construction. Those who have ever wondered where the term "stick built" comes from will find the answer in this book. Dimensional lumber are sticks in comparison to timbers. Though metal connectors used in today's framing have done wonders for total structural stability, this book shows you that timber framing negates the need for stamped steel reinforcement.Timber framed structures are built for permanence, preserving the strength of the frame by encasing it completely within the outer sheathing and exploiting the timbers as an aesthetic interior design element. It is amazing that so many barns and houses were built only by hand, because a single timber required two or more men to lift and transport. In this age, a crane is more appropriate. One should keep this in mind if considering this project on his or her own.The captions in the book are terse and straight forward. "Wood never lies to you." "You don't just hack away obliviously." As said before, the writing is eloquent, and one can feel the earnestness of the writer with every paragraph. This excerpt sounds like it was written this year, rather than 1980:"To insulate as well as we can and to make houses as tight as we can present new challenges to the building industry. Houses will no longer naturally ventilate because of our inability to get them tight. We can lock them up like thermos bottles if we like. To bring new air into the house, we'll have to design ventilation systems into the plans. With heat loss cut to the bones, we'll have to design natural and mechanical recirculation to keep the temperature even and the air fresh. In this kind of environment, the heat from appliances, lights, and even body heat will contribute significant proportions to the small heating requirements. In houses built this way, energy from the sun, wind, or water could easily replace fuel-fired power sources.""Energy conservation is the hope of the future. In conscience, we must mark the end of the era of substandard housing that is cheap to build but expensive and wasteful to maintain. In conscience, we should begin a time when houses contain energy-autonomous environments that consume no fossil fuels and are build to last centuries."Those words are nearly three decades old. They are describing what is sometimes called a "passivhaus" or "passive house", which is also an established building technique but is only recently seeing revival as a "green" building technique. Insulation, rather than expensive heating and cooling systems, is the key to energy efficiency. What the authors are showing is that with a timber frame, the outer skin can be insulated panels that are tightly sealed, making a water tight and nearly air tight structure that is stronger, more permanent, and more energy efficient than any home constructed from dimensional lumber.And if there is any gripe of the book, it is that there should be more detail on the outer sheathing and insulating techniques, as well as wiring methods. There are a few cross sections (fairly detailed) but they are not as comprehensive as other sections of the book. Perhaps in 1980 the insulated panel industry was not large enough to devote more than a few pages to it. But now, there are composite, structurally insulated panels of many varying types that can be used in conjunction with a timber frame to build a very efficient, very strong, and architecturally pleasing home. And this is yet another example of how things come full circle; one of the oldest building techniques proves itself to be superior to its modern replacement in multiple ways.On a personal note my building experience comes from the construction of a stick built garage which, at the time, seemed incredibly stout to me. I used 2x6 lumber for the walls rather than 2x4s, and sheathed the walls and roof with 5/8" oriented strand board. I used metal connectors in liberal amounts, reinforced the joints and ceiling joists, and insulated the entire structure so that I could work during the cold months. The garage is a solid, well insulated structure that maintains a comfortable climate by insulation and thermal mass alone. I was striving for a better way of building, and after reading this book I see that my desire was for timber frame construction. I wish I would have known more about it when I undertook the garage project, but now if I ever build my own home, I know how I will build it.Lastly, the appendix has diagrams for beam loads that is nearly more comprehensive than some textbooks on the topic of strength of materials. Even if you do not intend to build a home this way, this book may still be of value to you if you have any interest in building, construction, or architecture.For more information on finishing a timber frame home with different structural insulated panel technologies, see Benson's newer book: The Timber-Frame Home: Design Construction Finishing. It has more color photos and addresses the special considerations for foundations, plumbing, wiring, and insulating timber frame homes.

review/summary: PLAY IT AGAIN, VAN
review/text: The international piano competitions have a great deal of atmosphere and `buzz' about them, not to mention a great deal of politics like any other sport. Van Cliburn was the first non-Russian to win the Tchaikovsky competition in Moscow, and when the prize in the next of those seemed inevitably to be going to Ogdon the Soviet authorities pressed a reluctant Ashkenazy into entering to split the award with him. The reclusive Cliburn founded his own event in Fort Worth, and this disc contains a selection of the entries for the first two of the series in 1962 and 1966. Recorded material appears to be thin on the ground, and the only complete work of any great length here is the Copland sonata played by gold medallist Ralph Votapek in 1962. The other contributions are from Lupu, gold medallist in 1966, and from Nicolai Petrov who was apparently silver medallist in that year, although the liner-note tells us at another point that that award went to Barry Lee Snyder.Of the three, Lupu has made the big time and deservedly so, and my impression is that the other two have not. Votapek starts very well with a movement from one of the MacDowell sonatas, displaying a big tone at the start and a lot of sensitivity and sympathy to this slightly reactionary music later. In any case it's pleasant to hear anything by MacDowell these days other than To a Wild Rose. In the three Brahms numbers from op118 there are more wrong notes than I would expect to hear from a gold medallist in any of the more recent competitions, but they are agreeably played, showing a good sense of the composer's idiom and some real originality in the clog-dance effect that he gives to the rhythm of the ballade. The Copland sonata is proficiently done, with faster speeds in the outer movements than Peter Lawson adopts, but I can't really find this performance to be any kind of rival to Lawson's in any respect at all.From Petrov we get two Scarlatti sonatas plus another movement from one by MacDowell - all goodish but hardly outstanding to my own way of thinking. Whether or not hindsight comes into the matter, I start to get a genuine sense of occasion when Lupu takes the stage with the first movement of the second Prokofiev concerto. The orchestral contribution is not helped by a very indifferent piece of recording, but I was interested to hear Lupu in this music by way of a change from the Schubert and Mozart in which I know him better. Even in Schubert I have found flashes of real and even startling power at times as well as the lyric beauty of touch for which Lupu is more renowned, and his reading here has real stature and a commanding quality to it.The recorded sound is never better than good average and not always even that. There is naturally applause from the audiences (I wouldn't have felt I was getting my money's worth without it), and they seem to contain a considerable number of sufferers from pulmonary afflictions, but I guess that's all part of the atmosphere too. Absolutely nothing on this disc could even remotely be called essential for anyone's collection. This is a temps-perdu job, for the nostalgia market, and I enjoy it simply on that basis.

review/summary: A classic
review/text: Of all the AEC recordings, I think that this recording best defines who the AEC is.It generally is more raw than their ECM recordings, and this has the best balance between improvistation and composition. You have the otherworldly Illistrum, the raw but ritualistic title track, the R&amp;B tinged Scuffle Shuffle, and a few vibrant non-Western styles in What's to Say. Nonaah is how Stockhausen would have sounded if he had hung out in the South Side of Chicago.This effort has a get-down-to-business approach which leaves virtually no dead spots on this project.This recording gets the highest of possible ratings.

review/summary: best studio recording by the Art Ensemble!
review/text: I heard FANFARE FOR THE WARRIORS for the first time when it finally appeared on CD in 1999. The original LP had been released in 1974. It is the Art Ensemble's finest studio recording! Joined by Muhal Richard Abrams on piano, it is a flawless representation of the band's facets, talents, and overall effect. FANFARE opens with Joseph Jarman reading an epic Pan-African poem by Malachi Favors over the famous Ensemble "little instruments." This captures the theatrical and mythical elements of the band at the outset. Their performances were always rituals. The rest of the album is a perfect symmetrical journey. The sadly departed Lester Bowie kicks things off with the rollicking "Barnyard Scuffel Shuffel." Roscoe leads us into the mystical with his "Nonaah," culminating with the journey's destination -- Jarman's "Fanfare." A slighter Jarman piece "What's to Say" leads back to another enigmatic Mitchell passage, "Tnoona." The journey closes as always with a blues beat -- this time it's Roscoe's "The Key."The best Art Ensemble recording is the live URBAN BUSHMEN, but FANFARE is a close second, and is a perfect introduction to the band. The overall effect was/is always greater than the sum of the parts, but each part is more perfectly realized on this album than anywhere else in their recorded output.

review/summary: Another must!
review/text: Along with Bap-tizum this lp is a must and aptly documents the excitement that was the Art Ensemble of Chicago in the early 70's. From the lyrical exploration of &quot;Illistrum&quot; to the freeform taunting of the title track to the classically influenced &quot;Tnoona&quot; each and every song takes you on a sonic spiritual journey that few jazz records ever achieve. It's interesting to note that they did not release another album for five years and when they did their music had changed somewhat which makes this record that much more important as it is the final document of their first phase and an important one it is.

review/text: These wraps were not doing anything when we placed them in "hot" water. We searched the internet and found others having the same problem. The instructions are very poor. First off, you need to dip in boiling water (or at least some temperature level above what I would call hot). Second, the instructions don't describe what should happen, should the image shrink around the egg, transfer to it -- what?Needless to say, it was frustrating for a minute or two, but my wife - who is very intelligent and great in the kitchen - immediately thought, "well... hot water wouldn't do much to change the properties of the plastic, so let's try boiling water - nothing to lose."Should be more explicit in the instructions.

Numerous Jaquith ancestors were patriots who fought and died for this country from the King Philip's War on. The only reason I did not give this family biography a 5 star rating is because some of the historical data in the living members of the Jaquith family is not correct. The older the records, the more correct the data is.

review/summary: Great Classic Sega Arcade Racing Action!
review/text: If you've played this game in the arcade and liked it, then you'll definitely like this version to play at home whenever you like. You don't need a supercomputer to run it and the graphics and controls are amazing and faithful to the incredibly fun and fast arcade experience. This version also has plenty of unlockables, which you get by playing and earning miles, as well as mini-games that are a fun diversion from the classic arcade game. It has the European-themed levels of Outrun2 and the America-themed levels of Outrun2 SP, for a total of 30 stages to race through in the classic Outrun-branching style, or sequentially, or with challenges such as beating rival racers. This game is affordable, fun, and has plenty of replay value. You may not want to play it for hours and hours, but you'll keep coming back to it if you like to get a speedy arcade fix every now and then.

review/summary: Too much sugar is bad for you
review/text: I remember playing Outrun in the arcades when it came out in the, I think it was, eighties. It had flashy graphics, flashy steering wheel, pedals, and corny, but catchy, music. It was the kind of game I'd play on the way out of the arcade when all but the last dribbles of coinage had been spent on the more 'serious' (read challenging) games. Actually, when I think about it, Outrun was always placed by the entrance, perhaps for this reason. Main meal of games inside, followed by quick dessert on the way out. And Outrun is quick. And fun. And flashy. Colourful, pretty, and simple. Not much depth here, but some very cool twists on your standard arcade racer. Lots of different Ferraris, lots of different scenery and, wow, does it look good! Pure, unadulterated eye candy. Two problems, however. It wont run on full accelerated sound on my sound card (budget Creative), so I have to switch the acceleration back to minimum through my control panel or the game will just keep crashing when it comes time to race. Secondly, the configuration for gamepad bites. It won't allow me to allocate the buttons I want for acceleration and braking, so I end up using the right analogue joystick for both (left to accelerate, right to brake). Sounds dicky, and I suppose it is, but it's actually pretty easy to get used to. As far as I'm aware there are no patches for said problems. Despite these issues Outrun 2006 C2C is a blast, fun from go to wo. It's sugary sweet and just the thing for a low gaming BSL.

review/summary: Brilliant game with short lifespan.
review/text: The original Outrun is a timeless classic. It's one of those video-games that will last forever and it came out of the golden era of wonderful arcade innovations, along with Double Dragon and Splatterhouse. Outrun was the first great racer, better than Pole Position on the Atari!!!There have been plenty of sequels and spin-offs to Outrun from the kinda okay Turbo Outrun to the just plain stupid Battle Outrun. None really had that extra spark which made the original so amazing. Outrun 2006 may not end up a classic but is still a brilliant game in it's own right.Rekindling that hedonistic, free-spirited, just-get-in-and-drive-anywhere feeling and sacrificing all the modern racing features for just sheer joyriding pleasure, Outrun 2006 is just such an easily accessible game for anyone.As usual it's filled with gorgeous scenery, brilliantly blue skies and amazing music. The classic 'Magical Sound Shower' (a great, great tune indeed) has been remixed but it also contains the 1986 mix for the purists.The only negative thing I can say about this game is that once you've finished it 5 times (such as I have already) there's not much point in going back to the same old courses. They could have included more.Ah well, it's still a game you should invest time and money in.Graphics ASound AGameplay ALasting Appeal C+

review/summary: Dont run out to get Outrun unless your from 1985
review/text: Outrun was the biggest disappointment of my holidays.If you've just come home from a life in 1985 you might enjoy this. I read the reviews before buying but it didn't sink in what Arcade style meant. I am an addicted follower of Colin MacRea rally and thought to race a ferrari across the US would be cool. I was wrong. The games is to car racing what space invaders is to "Battlefield". The landscape moves instead of the car and you have these idiotic stages like impress your girlfriend with how many slides you can do. Total rubbish. Not anyones fault but mine, but I live in Ireland and got it shipped through Florida so it is a costly mistake.

review/text: "Time Note" may be singer-songwriter Hanako Oku's most widely known CD. It contains her two big hits from the 2006 anime film "The Girl Who Leapt Through Time." Her songs are romantic, emotional piano ballads sung in Japanese. Every track is heart warming -- or heart BREAKING, sometimes it is hard to tell. I'm not sure if my heart is breaking or filled with joy. The playing and singing is so good, you do not have to understand Japanese to feel the emotional effect. Her voice is like an angel.This is a great album from a great artist.

My husband finally bought him for me and I love him! I didn't get the classic, I did get the new version. He is slightly different from the old, classic version. His name tag is a bit different as is his coloring, nose, etc. But he is unbelievably soft and cuddly. I also bought one for my great-niece and nephew. Definitely recommend this product.

review/summary: Henry dog
review/text: There is something that Henry Dogs brings to a child. It's a simple toy, but such an amazing thing that happens when a child connects to it with love, companionship, and comfort. I first got my Henry Dog when I was 2 years old and it has bought much joy throughout my childhood. Now 35 years later, I still have my Henry Dog which sits in an old wicker chair in a corner of the guest room. My brother also had a Henry Dog back in the 70s, he too still has kept his Henry Dog for over 30 something years. He took his Henry Dog everywhere just as I had as a child. The Henry Dog has bought so much enjoyment as we grew up and still has a priceless value throughout our adult years. Most stuff animals children grow out of, but there is something with the Henry Dog that makes us want to hold on to it. I still love my Henry Dog, and best of all, my Henry Dog reminds me of a simple thing in life, to live life happy. Thank you for bring happiness to so many with the Henry Dog. I'm still waiting for the Henry Dog to be in stock one day so I can gift my child a Henry Dog to love and adore.

review/summary: Charisma
review/text: What it is about "Henry Dog". My daughter was 6 when we gave her Henry. Love is not the word. Obsession! A few years later my ex-wife decided he had to go. Under the guise of an "incurable" lice infection my ex-wife threw him out. Trauma followed. We bought a replacement which my daughter has safely on her closet shelf. He is thread bare. I found him online and was overwhelmed to read the reviews at Amazon.com. None had less than 5 stars. Each story told how this little guy had touched their lives. These Henry owners, both girls and boys, cherished him as if he had been a "real" dog. I guess to them, he is. Daddy had to buy his little (40 year old) daughter a new one. I got both the 14" and 3". I was on the phone when she opened the box..... Henry was home again. My granddaughter saw Henry got excited and wanted one also. She is 19 years old. This company should bottle "Henry Dog`s" charisma. Thanks for keeping him alive.

review/summary: Still got the toy since 1974
review/text: I've had this toy since I was a year old or so (honestly, I've had it for as long as I can remember). I can't believe they're still around. My 5 year old has inherited mine. She loves it very much. There isn't much too it, but for some reason she loves it just as much as I did. It's a great toy that is trans-generation. I'm sure someday my daughter will pass it on to her child, too. Henry the Dog will be around forever.

review/text: I had two Henry Dogs. One I lost in a ride at Walt Disney World, the second to replace it. I have no idea where Henry got to. But now that I found "him", I will have my friend again. I had this toy from the time I was six years old, almost 40 years ago, and I think I'll be seeing him again around Christmas time. It's a sweeet toy and really good for children of *all* ages!

review/text: Just wanted to add my voice to the chorus... :) I got this Henry for my little son 4 years ago. Of course, he's been my son's night companion ever since. We've taken him everywhere in our travels (and we do travel). Also sometimes poor Henry has to withstand some rough play during the day... I am not sure he will hold up for 40 years as the old ones did, but he's doing fine for now. This is a great toy.

review/summary: Newberger, Mazzy, and Thompson delight
review/text: If you've driven an hour to hear Ed Goldstein and Buddy Wachter, suffered through an interminable opening act to hear Jonathan Dorn and Leon Redbone, lamented that you've worn out the grooves your Howard Johnson and Taj Mahal &quot;Real Thing&quot; album, and purchased all of the recordings of Sam Pilafian and Frank Vignola, why, then, this is your genre. It's just plain fun--it makes you want to go make friends with a banjo player. The next best thing to having Eli Newberger, Butch Thompson and Jimmy Mazzy on your porch this summer would be to sit out there yourself with your boom box, your old rocking chair, a glass of iced tea, and this CD. The title of this recording is the same as that of a book by Newberger on the development of male character (Perseus, 1999). In the liner notes, Newberger cites a previous concert series &quot;Themes of Intimacy and Aggression,&quot; as using much of the same material as this recording, but one could simply characterize the men providing inspiration for these selections as &quot;bad guys and good guys,&quot; from &quot;Big Bad Bill,&quot; to being &quot;Wild About Harry.&quot; I can almost believe Jimmy Mazzy when he sings that he &quot;Ain't Misbehavin'.&quot;

review/summary: Good Overview of Subject
review/text: The book offers a good overview of the subject of woodburning. The types of tools needed are discussed; however, it was short on explanation here. The author should have spent more time examining the different types of tools and the qualities of each type. The book discusses the best types of wood for pyrographic efforts and this was useful. The book has a wide variety of designs from birds to seashore items. All are well drawn. The disigns are complex, and they are printed in the book very lightly. The problem in reproducing them comes from the lightness of the picture and the complex design. They do not reproduce as well as disigns I have found in other books.Overall I found the book informative and the designs excellent.

review/text: Although I was excited to purchase this book, my excitement didn't last when I looked at the sketches / pictures in the book. I call them pictures because that is what they truly are, not actual patterns. Norma Gregory's talent shows up well in her designs but due to their complicated rendering they are very difficult to transfer.This book is not for beginners - but more seasoned artisans.If you are looking for patterns, like I was, you will be disappointed in this book.

review/summary: A Valiant Effort, but it misses the mark.
review/text: Michele Soavi enjoys international cult-status as the maker of avant-garde horror films, and as such, his fans will not be disappointed with "Saint Francis." The first half of this movie's cup overflows with sinister characters, protracted violence, on-camera torture, and endless journeys through frightening dwellings and landscapes.That said, he made an admirable attempt to depict a "muscular" Christianity and present Francis's life without pastel colors. It had to be done and he did it. But, while this film is an artistically lush period piece and is conceptually intriguing, the realization is disappointing. The plot is somewhat muddled, the script doesn't justify its three and one-half hour length, and the characters are unremittingly stern---whereas, the hallmark of St. Francis was joy. (According to witnesses, he bore his year in prison "with cheerfulness and good temper." A better interpretation of the saint's troubadour-like personality is the father's character in the Italian film "Life is Beautiful.")Additionally, Soavi's portrayal of Francis' relationship with the Catholic Church is slightly skewed and incomplete.Saint Francis was a reformer, not a rebel.In Soavi's interpretation, Saint Francis appears as a precursor to Luther; that is, Christianity should be "sola scriptura." Add to that '"sola" nature' and '"sola"poverty' and you have the plot of this film in a nutshell. The Franciscan ideal does contain the Gospels, nature, and poverty, but it contains much more; obedience being high on the list. Saint Francis' faith was never at odds with the faith of the Catholic Church.Furthermore, belief that the Church did not allow men and women to read the Gospels in their native language is an erroneous belief, but it is widespread and one need not be anti-Catholic to hold it. This theme in the movie's plot is historically inaccurate. (What the Church guarded against were "Gospels" written in the vernacular that contained error. For those who are interested, Mario Derksen (Catholic Insight) in his essay, "Did the Catholic Church Try to Keep the Bible From the Laity?" uses modern and historical sources to argue that the Church was concerned with mis-translations, not translations.)For many good reasons Michele Soavi's film will (or, will not) resonate with viewers, but for an accurate picture of Saint Francis and Saint Clare one would do well to get a good biography. (G.K.Chesterton's "Saint Francis of Assisi," is a start.)

review/text: I looked forward to watching this movie, but was disappointed. Overall it is well made, but the representation of St. Francis was at best disappointing. I realize St. Francis's life was not a bed of roses, but there was almost no joy *AT ALL* in his life, according to this movie. Far too much crying for his character lines.Also, it was troubling to have St. Francis represented as someone almost bordering on disobedience to the Pope when he requests approval for his order. It is one thing to speak freely but they carried it too far for the saint who "rebuilt Christ's church."

review/summary: Very problematic depiction
review/text: Although visually sumptuous, gritty and sensual, this film has several problematic characteristics that prevent it from being either an enjoyable or edifying portrayal of St. Francis.In the first place, a_very_blatant Protestant plot element is inserted in the movie, with an apparent Waldensian St. Francis meets in prison. The man is there because he translated the Gospels into "the common tongue" and is then brutally tortured for such "heresy", but not before he passes his ragged Bible to Francis, whose faith is awakened by this first introduction to the Word of God.The second problem is that the movie does not attempt to attribute any sort of supernatural explanation to Francis' actions, but instead gives a naturalistic depiction of his life. God does not speak to Francis here. The closest we come to anything miraculous was when Francis and his brothers saw a large flock of birds. Even his stigmata is played down to resemble nothing more than scrapes on his hands. It is also hinted at that it is self-inflicted, since the movie earlier showed us Francis intentionally grasping a thorny stick as hard as he could, and wounding his hands.The third issue is that Francis' personality is just warped in this movie. He is portrayed as a delusional, self-harming, neurotic lunatic, an amiable simpleton at best. He is frequently shown crying, moaning, rolling around the ground in pain, spitting up blood. It is none-too-subtly hinted at that he was nuts.The fourth problem is that the movie is interminable. It is almost 3 hours long. If it contained any sort of plot development or dramatic tension, that would have been bearable, but with Francis mostly just acting strangely, it was not a pleasant experience.The movie isn't all bad, as I said. It is beautiful to watch, and so far as I can translate Italian, the acting seemed powerful to me. I was glad it didn't obscure Francis' faith, as Zefferelli's proto-hippy Francis seemed to do. However, the problems I elucidated above ruined it all for me.

review/summary: Interesting
review/text: An interesting early book by the great historian of ideas JGA Pocock. This book focuses on what Pocock calls the history of historiography in 17th century England. Pocock is concerned mainly with reconstructing how 17th century intellectuals thought about their past. This apparently recondite topic turns to have a number of interesting dimensions. Pocock begins with a surprising and interesting fact, that something prefiguring historical analysis emerged from the study of legal traditions. This occurred first in 16th century France, where the emerging methods of humanist textual criticism were applied to legal traditions. The existence of different legal traditions in France led several scholars to discover the dynamic quality of legal history, the discovery of feudalism, and reconstruction of legal history in the context of a form of social history. In England, where the common law tradition had no competitors, the evolution of knowledge followed a different course. The common lawyers, epitomized by the great Edward Coke, projected the common law and contemporary English political institutions back into an immemorial past as a permanent feature of English life. This treatment of English legal history was entangled in efforts to resist James I assertions of royal power.Subsequent scholars, notably the great antiquarian Henry Spelman, partly inspired by French scholars, subsequently discovered the changing nature of English law, discovered feudal law, and made inferences from legal history to imaginative and insightful reconstructions of medieval English society. Pocock evinces particular symppathy for Spelman's efforts to elucidate non-anachronistic understandings of key terms and concepts, an activity very similar to Pocock's own scholarly goals. Pocock traces the influence of Spelman's discoveries on subsequent scholars and how these reconstructions of English history were entangled in 17th century politics. This book concludes with a nice chaper on the treatment of English history following the Glorious Revolution, describing the emergence of the Whig version of English history and looking forward to the work of important 18th century historians like Robertson and Hume.Like of all of Pocock's work, this book is characterized by close analysis of the texts, Pocock's impressive erudition, and clear writing.

review/summary: Tales of the world I never knew and never will
review/text: Thanks to my grandparents, who came to America in the first decade of the 20th century, I grew up and have had a good life. Thanks to my grandparents, I didn't become a piece of ash or a few tossed out bones in an Eastern European field at the age of 2. Wars are wars; they've occured throughout human history, but in most of them, whole civilizations didn't disappear. But the Eastern European Jewish world is gone forever. I might belong to the same gene pool, but compared to the characters in Isaac Bashevis Singer's stories, I'm as American as apple pie. Irish-Americans can discover their roots in Ireland, Chinese-Americans in China, and so on, but not me. My cultural roots are gone forever. The only way I can learn them is through reading literature written by Singer, Shalom Aleichem, Isaac Babel and others who describe that vanished world. So, obviously, my interest and pleasure in reading such wonderful tales as appear in THE SEANCE and OTHER STORIES is all the more. Never mind my personal reasons. These amazing stories, by a Nobel Prize winner, will stay with you for a long time. The strange, sad characters afflicted by poverty and by life, bring us face to face with common human personalities of all times and places, while also depicting the conditions and peculiar relationships of Jews in Poland too. Magic, religion, animals, thieves, rabbis, prostitutes, mystics, Holocaust survivors, Talmudic scholars, prisoners, books, butchers and shopkeepers crowd the pages. In each story, you find pathos and tragedy, happiness and satisfaction, tensions and transformations. Two of the stories, "The Seance" and "The Letter Writer" must rank with the best stories I have ever read; none of the others are bad. If you have never read Singer, this is an excellent book to start with. If you have, you know what I am talking about. This is the great writer at the top of his form.

review/text: Isaac Bashevis Singer was no doubt one of the greatest short story writers - ever! The various collections in the end also earned him a very well deserved Nobel Prize for literature in 1978. Several of his stories were first published in magazines like The New Yorker, Encounter and Playboy. The first collection I read was Passions and Other Stories, which immediately made me realise what a master Isaac Bashevis Singer was. Later I have read several of his novels and short stories, where especially the collections Gimpel the Fool, Short Friday and The Seance are at least as good as Passions. All a magnificent world of Isaac Bashevis Singer's saints and sinners. Sad, funny, ironic, poignant and seeming to come from Singer's pen without any efforts. This is what good short stories is all about!

review/text: THE S&Eacute;ANCE AND OTHER STORIES is a collection by Isaac Bashevis Singer first published in 1968. Singer wrote primarily in Yiddish, and the 16 short stories here have been translated into English by various translators, though overseen by the author.Singer's stories are invariably set among Jewish communities, the majority in the Polish Jewish villages of the late Russian Empire, though three are set in the postwar United States. Readers of this collection should have a basic knowledge of Jewish customs, for example, what a mezzuzah is. Still, behind the trappings of culture, the characters are universal and anyone will recognize themselves and their acquaintances here. At times, however, Singer is more interested in allegory than realism, and the characters represent the Jewish people. Singer's depiction of Polish Jewish life is not a nostalgic reminisce of some purer age, and the frankness of Singer's themes is remarkable. The subject of "Yanda" is a provincial prostitute, while "Zeitl and Rickel" describes the doomed lesbian romance of two pious girls.Found by chance in a "take a book, leave a book" pile, THE S&Eacute;ANCE AND OTHER STORIES was my introduction to this Nobel laureate. While I'm not so bowled over by the stories to want to seek out other works by this author, the material is consistently entertaining (the 200 pages are a quick read) and some of the endings memorable.

review/text: This is the second time I have bought this jacket. I wore the first one out! I am an attorney and it is becoming difficult to find tailored clothes to fit a mature woman. I plan to buy this jacket in some other colors now that I have the proper size. This is a great easy wearing piece for any professional woman young or old.

review/summary: Unbelievable music!
review/text: I heard "Troya" on Sirius/XM's Chill station, and set about finding the music. "Dreaming Of" appears not to be available in MP3 (or I just missed it). If you have to buy it on CD, wait for a reasonable price here, or find it somewhere else online. Having heard the entire disc, I would have paid a lot more than I did. Still, the reseller prices I see as of this writing are a bit steep. I paid $18.50 including shipping -- a normal price for a title outside the mainstream. Worth every penny.

review/summary: Not sure about the title
review/text: This not a &quot;how to&quot; guide to &quot;swinging&quot; (or whatever people call it) but in fact much more a book that addresses the question of being together and growing with a partner while retaining individuality and seperatedness within a relationship of honesty, trust and openess. I felt a lot less cynical and much more positive about the institution of marriage as a result of reading this book.I thought it was excellent and I feel it's a book that would probably appeal to many more people if the title was different. But then again it was because of the title that I found it. Highly recommended for any relationship whether or not marriage is a part of it.

review/summary: A great informative must read. Not just for open marriage.
review/text: I feel that this book can apply to every romantic pairing. This is not just a book for those contemplating an open marriage. This is a book that can give you great ideas regarding space in a relationship. It expands on the idea that just because you are part of a couple does not mean you have to give up yourself. It promotes the idea of still mainting and developing new ideas and hobbies about yourself. It really has so very little to do with sex and more to do with keeping your own life exciting and not expecting the marriage to solve all your fulfilment needs.

review/summary: An Excellent Book about Open Marriage - NOT Swinging!
review/text: The title of this book has become misleading only because the meaning of the words "Open Marriage" has changed over the decades.This book is an excellent guide for people interested in all the aspects of attaining and living in an open marriage, which is an overall way of life, not just sexual freedom. Everything from sex to doing the dishes is covered in this book. Some of the language may sound dated since it's original printing, but then again, so does Shakespeare.This the best book I have ever found to learn about ALL aspects of your marital relationships (not just the sexual ones) and discover the ways in which people try to control and eventually destroy each other as individuals within a marriage.If you want a book on "swinging" (a/k/a recreational, non-monogomous sex) then this is NOT the book you are looking for. But then again, Open Marriage is leaps and bounds beyond just swinging. This book guides you through making this a way of life in a wonderful way, changing the traditional marriage views in ALL aspects, including non-monogomous sex, but not JUST sex.How do I know this? I've been living this way for 15 years and still going happy and strong. My first "traditional" marriage lasted 3 years.

review/summary: title refers to open communication and self examination, not swinging
review/text: Please don't be confused by the unfortunate choice of title, nor by the ridiculous books promoting promiscuity that are associated with it by Amazon databases.Let's examine the two negative reviews of this book.One reviewer admits that he had decided the book wasn't worthwhile before reading it, and proceeds with an attitude that dares the authors to change his mind. This is hardly an "open" reading, is it? Further, the message of this book is in no way negated by a supposed divorce between the authors. The authors of Open Marriage specifically instruct readers to examine their expectation that marriage lasts forever.Another reviewer has a vested interest in dismissing Open Marriage, because its ideas contradict those of a book he wrote. He is careful to advertise his own book in his negative review of Open Marriage.As for whether Open Marriage is outdated, since when did such things as communication and trust become outdated? With extremes of ideology and dogma on a rapid increase, a book that promotes careful examination of our assumptions and expectations before getting married has never been more relevant. Has Socrates' dictum "An unexamined life is not worth living" ever gone out of date?Briefly, I'll quote from chapter 4:"The guidelines [to healthy relationships] are as follows:1 realistic expectations2 privacy3 open and honest communication4 flexibility in roles5 open companionship6 equality7 identity8 trustWhere do love, sex, and fidelity fit in? Are these not guidelines too - the basic components of any marriage? Important, yes; guidelines, no. Many of the problems with the closed marriage [defined by poor communication, lack of trust, immaturity etc.] stem from a false concept of the part that love, sex, and fidelity play in the relationship between man and a woman. The guidelines of open marriage listed above form the basis upon which love, sex, and fidelity achieve their meaning, not vice versa. If personal identity is based on love, equality measured by sex, and trust defined by fidelity, then identity will be crushed by a lessening of the initial romantic fervor, equality diminished by a temporary failure in sex, and trust destroyed through even the appearance of infidelity. But if personal identity, equality and trust exist in full measure, then the normal fluctuations that occur in any relationship between two human beings can be taken in stride."One way of looking at the book Open Marriage is to say that the authors are discussing which comes first, the chicken or the egg? They are revealing that love, sex, and fidelity are outcomes of mature relating, thus not the cause of mature relating. If we reverse causation and pursue the product directly, without the process, than we set in motion a degradation from expectation, to demands, to manipulation, to frustration, and ending in "bitter disappointment" (chapter 4). For example, suspicious jealousy pursues fidelity directly, bypassing the process of building trust and commitment. On the other hand, when we follow the above 8 principles of healthy relating, the likely outcome is love, and fidelity. I recall a TV Sitcom in which a holiday family reunion wasn't going well, and someone angrily threatened that "we all had better start having fun right now!" Again, pursuit of the outcome directly without the process, results in our realizing the very thing we most fear (can you hear echoes of Dr. Phil McGraw in this?)The authors are saying that an unexamined marriage will fail because our unconscious assumptions, demands, and expectations are going to take over, and a great deal of negative conflict will result. These authors are simply saying that we need to pay attention and be proactive, examine our thoughts and feelings openly, and negotiate a mutually acceptable relationship. This open communication and cooperation, as opposed to conflict, is what the authors refer to in the title of their book. They are referring to a Socratic openness to challenging one`s own thoughts and behaviors as a basis of healthy living. This point is strongly supported by Dr. M. Scott Peck, author of The Road Less Traveled, who refers to Open Marriage on page 93 of ...Traveled. Dr. Peck's says the same thing with a different metaphor: we ought to examine our mental "maps" and be willing to revise them to keep ourselves dedicated to reality. Let Dr. Peck's reference carry more weight than mine.

review/summary: Outdated & overripe
review/text: This book reached its "sell before" date about 25 years ago. Better books have been written, but haven't been hyped so thoroughly, so it keeps getting reprinted.The "open marriage" concept has -- REPEAT AFTER ME -- absolutely nothing to do with sexual nonmonogamy. Rather, the authors examine the problem of what another author has called "the couple front," where couples feel they must act as if they're surgically joined, & end up feeling confined & eventually hating each other.If you are NOT interested in nonmonogamy, then read ANY book by Harville Hendrix & you'll find thoughts that are much more practical.If you ARE interested in nonmonogamy (group marriage, polyamory, etc.), then start with Intimate Friendships (Ramey), Polyamory (Ravenscroft -- whoops, that's me), Polyamory (Anapol), Honest Sex (Roy & Roy), or Group Marriage (Constantine & Constantine)... or even The New Faithful (Nearing), or Three in Love (Foster).I usually see ten copies of this book at any thrift store. That's somehow fitting.

review/text: This book is a classic when it pertains to building and establishing a relationship that works for you and your partner. It is written with a much different perspective and definition of an open marriage than today's view of Open Marriage.I highly urge anyone in a relationship to read this book together with their partner as a way to stimulate and nurture individual and collective growth.Please keep in mind the time period this book was written in, as some of the examples used to illustrate points will not speak to the current dynamics between the sexes.Overall, it's a thoughtful and transforming read.

review/summary: Actually, some decent advice.
review/text: The criticisms of this book are mostly about its non-monogamous aspect: the O'Neills (allegedly) broke up, therefore their relationship style is null and void. By this logic, is monogamy null and void, because monogamous people divorce? No type of relationship--straight, gay, monogamous, polyamorous, etc--is guaranteed against breakup. There are also horrendous relationships that are together forever because of desperation or beliefs. Even if there is a higher percentage of breakup in a certain relationship style, is "together until death" the only measure of a valid relationship?As many people pointed out, "open marriage" back then didn't mean specifically what it does now. In this book it means communicating openly, treating each other as equals, and allowing each other personal freedom. Most of this book is about how to get along better in a relationship by remembering that you both are individuals. You don't have to do everything together or have everything in common. You don't have to give up separate interests that your partner doesn't share. You don't have to give up friends when you get married. Giving up things like that don't make couples closer; they make couples resent each other and also take away their outside support systems.They mention non-monogamy as a possibility if both partners agree to it. They mention that depending on the context, sex with another person may not be the most horrible betrayal in a marriage (I said, depending on context. There are plenty of times it is a major betrayal.) Specifically I remember the passage about "the grass is always greener", and how with no fence, there is less of that feeling.My criticism of the "love and sex without jealousy" chapter is they talk about not having jealousy, but aren't very specific about how to deal with it and how to overcome it. (There are other books on open relationships that go into more detail about that.)Another criticism is that at times it relies on a premise of both people having careers that allow for economic independence. A career like that is not available to all people; there is no reason that only people with good careers should be able to have good relationships.There are lots of self-help books that promise a "one and only way" to have a satisfying relationship if you follow some off-the-wall advice, including the "emotional infidelity" variety that do advise couples to avoid friends and spend all of their time together. This book, in comparison, is common sense. Whether you want to be monogamous or non-monogamous, I think this book provides practical advice that should be elementary, but often isn't.

review/text: The O'Neills' exciting, original approach to married life shows you and your mate how the stifling, limited arrangement you've always thought marriage had to be can be opened up into an honest, undemanding, joyful relationship. they'll introduce you to the OPEN MARRIAGE concepts-trust, liking, role flexibility, individual freedom and growth, and love and sex without jealousy-that can do wonders for your marriage. OPEN MARRIAGE must be read before you get married-or before your marriage gets a day older!~*~This book needs to modernized. I see there is a 1984 version, but I don't know how that fits in today's age. It is a dry read, but I pushed thru and did get a few ideas to allow my own marriage to grow and flourish.

review/summary: As Bad a Production as Possible
review/text: This Broadway Theatre Archive production took one of the wittiest, most sparkling 18th-century comedies--and ruined it. The costumes are intentionally absurd (think Beach Blanket Babylon), the acting is way over-the-top-camp, and the incidental music could not be worse. The music, BTW, is a combination of pop Renaissance and pop modern; anything but 18th century. The director appears to have had the goal of showing that his company was just too hip and too modern to do anything but make fun of this silly, fusty old play.I like "The School for Scandal" very much, and not having found any other DVDs of it, I started out with the intention of keeping a recording of even a bad production. But when they got into the extended bop-be-bop of the drinking song scene, I knew I just couldn't ever sit through this one again.The visuals are also blurry, but with the production being so bad, so what? Anyone who actually likes this play will be revolted by this DVD.

review/summary: Hands down the best SCHOOL... I've found
review/text: If all you care about is slick packaging and color video, by all means pass on to the thoroughly acceptable color DVD from the Broadway Theatre Archive, but if you want to see Richard Brinsley Sheridan's classic Restoration Comedy, THE SCHOOL FOR SCANDAL, performed by a theatre cast which would be hard to beat, this wonderful production starring a very young Joan Plowright and the always wonderful Felix Aylmer (don't miss him in the theatrical films of Bernard Shaw's THE DOCTOR'S DILEMMA and SAINT JOAN) should be on your shelves. The smash hit 1963 Broadway production (recorded on Command Records) with John Gielgud and Ralph Richardson *may* have surpassed this production for polish, but I have yet to see a film or video production which could.Sheridan's play premiered in London during the spring of 1777, and was playing in New York before the final shots were fired in our War For Independence. I'm having trouble finding the exact date of the broadcast documented in this Video Yesteryear release (and how I wish the packaging on more video releases from even more "upscale" releasers included such important information), but this video gives you the feel of what our founding fathers (and the British officers occupying New York for most of that war) must have enjoyed when it was new - the very graininess of the released film contributes to the illusion - and reminds us as effectively as the wonderful 1776 musical that they were actually flesh and blood people too. What a pleasure to share a high pleasure like this with them.

review/summary: A step in the right direction!
review/text: This is ground breaking work. It moves away from the abstract, dualistic ideas of God that are grounded in Greek philosophical and pagan concepts. T. F. Torrance describes in detail where these ideas originated from and how they often threatened the integrity of the gospel. The churches in the first few hundred years were forever challenged with concepts and ideas that had no grounding in Scripture and tradition. By contrasting Jesus Christ as the centre for all our understanding about who God is and what God does against false concepts, Torrance very effectively shows how the church today has lost this vital focus. I would consider this book to be a masterpiece in bringing the cosmic reality of the gospel in the person and work Jesus Christ to a shocking and utterly staggering degree. If you dare to read this book, be prepared to be radically changed forever!

Nowadays, though, Mini DV seems to be taking over with even smaller cassettes and better picture quality. However, I don't have that kind of money to afford a DV or Digital 8mm camcorder. Yet.Enter the TRV-108, a nifty little video camera that uses the HiBand 8mm format, superior to 8mm, but certainly not in the ballpark of Digital8 or DV. Still, its compact size and light weight make it easy to carry around almost anywhere and given the first 8mm camcorder I ever used was big enough that part of it sat on my shoulder, this is a great improvement. It comes with a 160 minute `InfoLithium' battery and little else except a lens cap and strap. It takes great pictures and has a nifty menu system navigated by a little wheel at the back that works like like a volume control and when you have selected what you want from the on-screen display, you just press the wheel to make it happen. This makes titling a snap. I do miss the title image-grabbing function from older 8mm cameras, though.The 2.5" color back lit LCD screen is clear and easy to read in all but the brightest sunlight and failing that, it also has a small .5" black and white display through the view finder. The 40x zoom is fantastic, but you better have steady hands in order to use it. And using the 460x digital zoom is impossible with anything but a tripod. The camera is equipped with a nightshot mode that actually does work, amplifying light in dark areas, making the image more visible, if green. The TRV-108 also comes with some neat digital effects like sepia tone, which gives video a nice old movie look, a pastel effect which gives everything a cartoony look, black and white, 16:9 aspect shots, plus other effects. It can also do snazzy digital fade-ins and fade-outs.This camera only really has two failings. For the most part, built in camera lights are useless, but the TRV-108 doesn't even have an accessory shoe for mounting an external light source. Something I found kind of maddening to the point where I even toyed with the idea of finding a camera at a garage sale, ripping it apart, and super glue the shoe to the top. Second, while the built-in microphone is very sensitive at picking up voices and ambient sounds, it does not have a foam wind sock. In moderate winds the roar of the air as it passed over the mike caused a lot of noise. And if it's too loud, like when I shot at the base of a waterfall, the noise caused image distortion lines! These two missing features cost the camera a full five-star review.All in all though, this is a pretty decent little toy. It's not a serious camcorder and a far from a Canon GL-1s or Xl-1s, but for what I use it for, it's still pretty darn good. It's also low cost enough that purchasing it and using it as a good way to find out if you want to go for a bigger and better camera with more features, whether it be a Digital8 or Mini DV camera. It has taught me a lot about framing shots and what a pain the noon day sun can be. The long life of the battery means that, with a little mental effort, you can shoot a full 2 hour tape on one battery. Not bad for a trip to the zoo to send a tape to your folks.

review/summary: Poor battery life mars a decent camcorder
review/text: Hi8 is fast fading into oblivion as MiniDV takes over the world and gets cheaper. If you want good video quality, you should go with a namebrand MiniDV camcorder -- I recommend Sony, Panasonic and Canon. On the other hand, if you don't shoot a lot of videos and want something cheap, the Hi8 is still a good way to go. (I bought the TRV108 as a gift but tested it before giving it to my uncle-in-law.)To someone who's used to MiniDV camcorders, the TRV108 feels big. It's actually normal for a 8mm camcorder. The LCD screen is sharp and bright -- but as we shall see later, also a battery hog. The traditional eye-piece viewfinder is b&w;, which is bad if you want to use it to conserve battery power.The TRV108 gives out good video quality on Hi8 tapes. I would rate it "high" for a Hi8 model, but even the cheapest MiniDV camcorders (except for Samsung) can match such quality -- plus they offer more bells and whistles. One nice thing is the inclusion of Sony's NightShot infrared technology -- now you can turn your lights off and make those ghostly videos like in Blair Witch Project and Silence of the Lambs. :) The TRV108 also includes a host of effects you can add to your video footage.One bad thing, though, is this model does not have the stabilizer. The TRV308 and other more expensive models include Sony's digital stabilizer. On the other hand, digital stabilizers degrade quality, so they work better on a digital camcorder than an analog one like the TRV108. Just make sure you have sturdy hands and arms.Now the battery. The battery is definitely a problem and you'll want to buy an extra capacity battery. While the LCD turned on, you'll run out of the included battery in a matter of minutes. You can save power by using the b&w; viewfinder, but that defeats the purpose of having the LCD, doesn't it? One plus feature is the included AC adapter works at both 110V and 220V.If you have [the money], I highly recommend a MiniDV camcorder. Otherwise, make the TRV108 your entry-level home video making machine. You just can't beat its price and good quality for a Hi8 model.

review/summary: Best Deal in Sony Hi8 Camcorder Ever!
review/text: I've been waiting and waiting for the best value in a Sony Hi8 Camcorder and by far this is it! This is my very first camcorder. I've been doing a lot of research and comparison on which sony model will suit me best, then this came out. I quickly grabbed it after finding out how reasonably priced it was. I bought it at [a local store] during [a] Sale... I've never laid hand on a camcorder before and I am very pleased to find out how easy it was to operate. I was able to do the playback on my TV and dubbing on my VCR with ease. It has great features, great sound and best of all best picture quality. I know there are a lot of people out there like myself who are not ready to spend a lot of money on a camcorder especially for the very first time. Well, you will not be disappointed with this one! It comes with all the accessories to get you started. Battery charging is very fast, instructions are easy to follow when it comes to recording, playback and editing, the night shot feature is great, best of all the LCD screen is so fun to use especially when you have a "little one" to capture on video. This is definitely as great buy!

review/summary: Affordable Camcorder for Novice Users!
review/text: This was our family's first camcorder and I'd have to say that it does its job wonderfully. This camcorder has all the basic features you need to create great home videos. Our results so far are very satisfying. The only drawback is that you must buy an extra battery AND a camcorder bag! These are essential accessories that you must get if you plan to travel with your camcorder. What I love about this camcorder is that it could automatically convert to 220V, which is great when you travel. There's also the nightshot feature. I guess what this lacks is the 'image stabilizer.' However, I heard that stabilizers may actually worsen the picture quality on Hi8 camcorders. Whatever the case, we are very happy with our purchase and would highly recommend this product. It's high quality by a great brand and it would last you til you upgrade ...

review/summary: Great camera for the price
review/text: Wanted a camera for Christmas and got this one because of the price, and needless to say it's a great camera. Just got back from DisneyWorld and the 108 performed extremely well. The nightshot proved handy in those dark rides, and the quality of picture was well for the Festival of the Lion King performance. The only problem I saw was that the autofocus was slow to adapt at times during those fireworks and laser shows. I didn't expect it to keep up, but it did better than I expected. Talk about impact resistant, I had a hissy when it fell out of the bag into the boat on the pirates of the carribean, but it took a lickin and it's still ticking. Once home, I just connected it to my TV and watched my vacation replay. Great camera for the price, definately worth more. Only thing better is digital. Sony has a winner here.

review/summary: Replaced Old Sony TR 100 Hi 8 With this
review/text: My old hi 8 went caput after 10 years use that was very trouble free.The new one has way more features that the 100 and costs much less. ...I use the viewfinder instead of the display as I am used to it and so far have recorded 3 hours on it and it tells me I have 2 hours left. I used the telephoto constantly which takes power put am very happy with the resultsI recharge the battery after use with the no memory effect so no problems. I use the supplied battery for dubbing and it will run 2 hrs in the dubbing mode which is great.I dub hi 8 super vhs output to a super vhs vcr and do not notice andy difference in the quality of the dub.Yes there is a more blurry picture if you dub to standard vhs but that is normal.Unless you want to do some super pro stuff this camera is the one to get. Dave PS get metal evaporated tape for top notch 400 lines picture quality.

review/summary: Great for a first camera
review/text: The camera is very easy to use. It's not as bulky as other reviews make it out to be. The battery life has been great and the picture clarity has been great also. I have been using it to tape track meets and everything can be seen clearly. Remember that you will have to buy tapes for this camera, but that is no problem for the clarity you will get. I have not tried out all the other features like night vision, but from what I have seen so far, this camera is a real good bargain. I know 5 other people who have the same item and they do not have any complaints.The flip out lcd screen is clear also. It's like using a digital camera...but only with the tapes. Only downside I have seen is that it is a little hard to keep steady based on the videos watched. The camera seems to move around alot, but again, the picture clarity is great regardless of the low price. If you don't want to upgrade to ditigal, start with this camcorder. You will not be disappointed.

review/summary: Serendipity!
review/text: I was very pleased with the video camera. However, it had a problem which turned out to be a blessing in disguise. Like my original camera, it wouldn't move the tape in any direction. More than that, the tape would not go all the way down and came back out. Then I noticed that a rubber roller (turned out to be the capstan roller) was loose at the bottom of the tape area blocking the tape from going all the way down. I shook it out, but the tape wouldn't move ... just like the problem with my original video camera. Upon looking closer at my original camera, I noticed the capstan roller was loose in it also but not in a position that didn't prevent the tape from loading. After finding the manual on-line, I saw where the capstan went.I know I wouldn't have been able to fix my original camera if I hadn't purchased my new cameral through Amazon. Since I just paid half of what the original camera cost me (which was already heavily discounted), I am very happy with the result. Further searching on-line revealed to me that this is a common problem with this camera. The solution was also revealed ... always have a tape in the camera, and the capstan will not get loose. I suspect that when the camera was mailed to me that it was working fine, but the rigors of the shipment probably knocked the capstan loose since it came with no tape insideSony CCDTRV118 Hi8 Camcorder with 2.5" LCD. I am very happy at this unusual experience, and continue to be delighted that I have had great results everytime I purchase anything from Amazon. The reason I purchased the 2nd camera is that I have a lot of tapes of my grandson (now 21) playing Little League baseball that I want to copy onto DVDs and now will take more videos of my younger grandson playing ball. One thing I've always loved about this camera is that it is easy to use, and it has a zoom to "kill for." Sometimes I use it as an electronic telescope because it is so powerful.

review/summary: GREAT CAMERA - HOMERUN!!!!!
review/text: I exclusively buy Sony Electronics because in my opinion they are the best. When I bought this Camera I knew that the quality would be there because it is a Sony. The camera works well except it is a little bulky. I primarily use this camera to film my son playing in the little league and it works well at capturing high speed action. It also is somewhat impact resistant because at his last little league game the umpire claimed my son was out when he was safe. Everyone knew that except for the umpire himself. I hit that fat porker right in the face with the camera (while it was on) and it captured everything - the picture quality was amazing and the sound was crystal clear. That fat slob hit the floor like a ton of bricks and was out cold. A couple of weeks later I got a letter from his lawyer and I had to appear in court because he filed a lawsuit against me. I showed the judge the tape of my son being safe and even he commented on the quality of the sound and picture and said my son was not out either. The judge dropped the charges all because of this great little camera.

review/summary: No instructions included...
review/text: The price was right for this cable ($11.95+$4.94 S&H;) compared with Sony Ericssons offering ($25+). There are a few different prices on Amazon through the same company, MyNetDeals.com, so make sure you get the $11.95 one.So I popped the CD in, followed the 2 line .txt instruction file on the disk and...nothing happened?!? Well, my phone started to charge. If you have a similar problem you may try what I did.I had previously installed a variety of the S.E. downloadable software on my computer. It took me about 15 minutes of fumbling around, but I made my way to the Phone Monitor Options by opening the catcheventatl.exe in C:\Program Files\Sony Ericsson\Mobile\Mobile Phone Monitor. From the pop-up window you have to hit the Options button. There may be a better way to get here, but this is how I did it. Go to the COM Ports tab and enable all of the COM ports. It told me it wouldnt enable COM4 because of an IR conflict, but within a few seconds, my phone was recognized, presumably on one of the remaining ports. I may not have had this issue if I installed the software fresh with the cable, but I had previously been using the IR feature to transfer data. The cable is faster than IR, but not tremendously. The big benefit is you dont have to worry about losing line of site and messing up your download.Hope you have success.

review/summary: Beware 3rd Party Cables & Sony Ericsson Tech Support
review/text: Well, it technically does what it is supposed to do--that is, allows you to transfer files from your phone to your computer or vice versa. But, it is rude & puts up a fight to do so. The thing came with no instructions, so it took forever to install. Once installed, it creates a desktop icon which can't be removed or modified...because it's not actually a desktop icon (when I figure out what exactly this thing is, I'll post it) or in the registry at all. Actual transfer of files takes over the entire computer (don't have anything else running) and is slower than a floppy drive! I've found a ton of settings and such that the software changed without asking (rude in my book), so I'm probably going to have to re-install Windows to get everything back the way I like it. Although, it's nice to have the pics off my phone to email and have a custom wallpaper & ringtones on my phone, I'm really thinking of returning this rude little punk. If I could, I'd give it zero stars.(I'm not 100% sure that this will make a difference since the main problem appears to be Sony's software that you download from them, but the cable appears to be made by someone other than Sony and the oficial Sony Data cable is pretty much only sold through Sony's website.)Update on 6/4/2006:I was given a data cable for my Sony Ericsson z500a as a gift (turned out to be a 3rd party cable like this product is). At first, I was happy that I'd be able to transfer pictures taken with my camera phone to my computer to email to friends back home...but after installing everything, the thing only worked a few times at a nerve-rackingly slow pace. After tons of headaches messing with that, I contacted Sony's tech support. They don't seem to know how to figure out problems very well, and about all they could do on that call was get my info to send out a new cable. The new cable (Sony Ericsson cable) doesn't seem to work either, and I've called them several times now--each time speaking with 2-3 reps.So, my advice would be to not bother with the data cable (third party or Sony's) since neither will work properly. If you have a third party cable such as this product, don't tell Sony tech support because then they won't help you, so you're basically just out the money you spent on a cheap unofficial cable. Just enjoy your Sony Ericsson z500a & watch anyone who has a camera phone that has a working data cable for ideas for your next phone.

review/summary: Don't Take the Chance - Get the SE Branded Cable
review/text: If you purchase this data cable, you need to know that you will receive no real directions or information regarding what to check if nothing works. As directed, I downloaded all of the files from the SE site (70MB on dial up!), and then downloaded all of the user guides. Everything seemed to install ok, but nothing would make my phone be recognized. After that I scoured the SE site for troubleshooting info on their branded cable-in the hope that something would help me figure out the problem. After 2 full days of beating my head against the wall, I finally threw the cable and the useless CD that came with it in the trash.If I had used my brain I would have paid the extra $$ for a SE branded cable and software (and the support that comes along with that). I now have the real deal (SE data cable and software), and guess what? Yep, installation was a breeze and it works beautifully. You really do get what you pay for.

review/summary: Masterful interpretations
review/text: Of many CDs I've purchased in the last couple of years, this easily ranks as one of the best. Kudos to Muse for finally recording Spaulding as a leader in 1988 and now to Joel Dorn for reissuing the disk.As the title indicates, &quot;Brilliant Corners&quot; is filled with music by Monk. But what stands out is the freshness of the interpretations of the master's pieces. Rather than simply trying to sound like Monk, Spaulding and his cohorts try -- very successfully -- to make music that builds on Monk's ideas.Spaulding tears through every solo he has on alto, and offers beautiful contrast with his flute playing, as on &quot;Let's Cool One.&quot; He's aided by trumpeter Wallace Roney, who abandons his occasional propensity for imitating Miles Davis and instead lets his own sound shine through. Pianist Mulgrew Miller has never sounded better. In fact, the whole group (Ron Carter on bass and Kenny Washington on drums) strongly delivers the message that they are playing music that they love. There is no better way to express that love than by offering the robust voicings that you hear on this disk.If there is a regret when you listen to this music it is that Spaulding, who contributed so much to Blue Note dates in the '60s, has had so few opportunities to further explore his own muse. Better late than never.

review/summary: A fine effort by a mainly forgotten star
review/text: Story goes that after a number of excellent second horn sessions on mid 60's Blue Note where flute.alto,and soprano were wielded masterfully by James Spaulding he was given a shot as a leader.He was the non star(leader) that was called in many,many times.But at the point he got his offer Direction/Production had switched from Alfred Lion to Francis Wolff and A&R; fro Ike Quebec to Duke Pearson.Bottom line was they offered Spaulding a shot if he would fit into the new funky blues idiom of the Liberty era and he refused not being true to the hard bop form.Well even though he recorded few albums as a leader latter on labels like Muse("Smile Of The Snake" and "Blues Nexus are also fine 4 star or better efforts).He he has and excellent session with Wallace Ronney on trumpet,Mulgrew Miller and Ron Carter on bass, and Kenny Washington on drums.Fine line up.And though there are so many Monk tribute Lp's it is the musicianship wielded with passion that makes this a cut of above.As mentioned his flute playing is fine.I find jazz flute hit or miss and here it just works fine.Not a direct copy of the Monk style it shows th timeless of the compositions (not that a total analogue LP with some personal character is bad-see Walter Davis Jr. piano solo "In Walked Thelonius").I'd call this no an essential Lp but for Monk fans it may be.CheersChazz

review/summary: Espionage and paranoia
review/text: If you enjoy spy novels primarily for their depiction of paranoia, this album is well worth getting. The lyrics were written by Jeanette Obstoj, and for me they play a huge part in making this album tense, sometimes unsettling, and interesting. Basically, I think the lyrics are great, and Rupert Hine does a great job of delivering them in a very precise, chilly, and thankfully unaffected voice.It might be a concept album. Certainly thematically there is a great deal of continuity from song to song. To emphasize that, Rupert Hine mixed it so many of the songs fade up from out of the preceding one, which makes the album seem more cohesive.Musically, it has a bit of a prog-rock, new wave/synthesizer feeling. A few things save it from the perils of either genre (bombast and brittle anemic prodcution, that is). First, the production is fantastic. Crystalline, really. What synthesizers there are sound quite varied and interesting, and not thin imitations of string lines like so many early 80s synth bands used. Think more Japan or Thomas Dolby than say Duran Duran or other less interesting bands. Also, there's a lot of acoustic percussion on this, like marimba and wood blocks. Second, the music and songs are very economic and tense, with very little messing around on solos. As good as the music is, it's very much a vehicle for the lyrical subject matter, which is tense, nervous, and very much in the crosshair's site. Third, Rupert Hine is a great soundpainter, using thunder, rain, and ticking clocks to heighten the mood, making the overall impression very much like a spy movie or film noir.This album might be almost 30 years old, but the quality of the production, arrangements, subject matter (paranoia and espionage will never go out of style), and playing render it incapable of aging in a negative way. Fantastic job, Rupert!

review/text: This was the 2nd recording in Hine's early 80's A&amp;M Trilogy. As fine as it is, his first, Immunity, is the better work. This one lacks some of the intensity, and downright scariness that marked some of the previous work. Still, there are some standout tracks such as &quot;The Set-Up&quot; with clever lyrics and a great melody. &quot;Eleven Faces&quot; explodes with a vast sound. &quot;Dark Windows&quot; is set to the sound of a Thunderstorm, and is suitably brooding and haunting. Get this one after Immunity, but well worth having if you like Immunuty.

review/summary: Never gets going
review/text: This book never really seems to get going. There is too much time spent in the courtroom while basic questions about the crime and the suspect/defendant are left unasked.After 200 pages, I realized that this book wasn't going to pick up or reveal any crucial information to make sense out of things until the very end.As a result, the whole story rapped up very quickly in an unbelievable way and you are left wondering why no one could figure anything out earlier. Based on the ending, the detectives and attorneys appear rather incompetent.I did enjoy parts of the book, however, and I think the plot needs to be unfolded at a different rate (not so slow in the beginning and not so fast at the end). I am a McBain fan and think that some of his other books are better written.

review/summary: Fissure a mile-wide in this thin, confusing novel.
review/text: Early on in this story reader is informed that main character has a split personality. 3 girls are murdered and buried in back yard of Mary Barton, protagonist. Mary B. is sweet and loves her garden. Her other half is wicked to the max. The novel starts with her cussing like a sailor, wholly unlike sweet Mary B. The incredibly stupid atty. doesn't infer anything about the seeming two Mary's. Mary B. charged with murder that she obviously committed. Most of book contains court scenes that are well-written but are merely banal and static, the story stops. After conviction inevitable knife attack on atty by bad Mary, who we now learn is a twin of good Mary; at least that's the way the book reads. Within the reality of the book this is impossible and nonsense. But the reader is supposed to believe that good Mary has an evil twin who did the killings...I read the ending of the novel several times to see if it was communicating to the reader that the bad Mary was just the evil side of Mary B., i.e. she has a split personality. But, no, the book is saying that there are two Maries...not one with a good and bad side. If you want to read a lot of fairly interesting courtroom questioning by prosecutor and def. atty, most of the book is irrelevantly devoted to this, so read it and enjoy an O.J. moment. Perhaps the worst mystery/suspense novel I have ever read. This is my fourth and last McBain novel. HIs stories read at supersonic speed and purposefully divert the reader from thinking about the plot, characters, conflict,etc. Recommended solely for no-depth crowd of mystery readers (90% of readers are in this category; hence, the popularity ofjames patterson, Sue Grafton, Kellerman's,and many more; can anyone actually read Elizabeth George's prose and not become constipated and nauseous). Also, irrelevant romance between Mary's defense atty and female prosecutor. Added nothing to story, except perhaps to be a lame red herring that the femme fatale might have something to do with the murders.

review/text: I knew there was something missing from the first book when I read it, because it didn't match what I heard her say years ago when she came to my church to speak. Now I know, the abuse was so difficult for her to talk about even when she wrote a book about it. Later, with the help of a trusted friend, she was able to tell the most difficult and abusive parts of her childhood experience. This what the second book is about. The most wonderful thing about Dorie, is that she is able to forgive her abusers and move on with her life. She is still able to have a successful and happy life, in spite of the horrendous abuse of her childhood. This is what so many women need to hear. With the Lord's help, it is possible!

This is one of a set of books geared toward educating the person, the counselor, as well as the general public in the harms caused by sexual abuse, but it also highlights the resilency of the person who has gone through it.

Some of it is good,while some of it will never vibrate my speakers again.Drum fans will enjoy the variety of excellent drummers. If you want to get into Brand X, this is not the best place to start( go back to the late 70`s stuff).

review/text: Ever put on a record and known exactly what year it was recorded just by the sound ? Well, if not, try slapping this one on your turntable ... it literally screams mid-1980s. Needless to say, depending on your age and perspective, that may or may not be a good thing. So in the case of Ty Brunson's "Fresh" it'll depend on how you feel about mid-1980s funk complete with all of the ingredients - banks of synthesizers,, syndrums, pop bass, vocoders, etc... Anyhow, Ty Brunson's a local product, so my comments may be a bit biased ... as always, take them with a grain of salt.Born and raised in Washington, D.C.. Brunson's first taste of recognition came as a member of Osiris Marsh's funk band Osiris/Osiris the Band. A more than decent late-1970s DC-based funk outfit, they were quite popular locally, but never enjoyed that breakout hit. As the band's bassist Brunson struck out on his own in 1980, subsequently signing a solo deal by the Columbia-distributed Believe In a Dream label.Produced by Russell Timmons Jr., "Fresh" was Brunson's sophomore album. To be perfectly honest, it was far from the most original set you've ever heard. Musically the set offered up a mixture of Larry Graham-styled funk numbers ('Head Games') and conventional 'love man' ballads (''In Love with You'). Taken individually most of the seven tracks were actually pretty good, but the set's main downfall was the complete absence of originality. This was literally one of those albums where you spent the whole time thinking to yourself "that sounds like ..." Giving credit where due, Brunson had a nice voice (except when he tried to sound Jamaican ('Jet City') and was a decent bassist, though that talent was seldom spotlighted on the album.- Opening up with an arsenal of 1980s sound effects, including some of the cheesiest synthesizers you've heard in a long time, syndrums, vocoders, banks of chirping female backing singers, 'Servo Go-Go' sounded like something out of the George Clinton funk family. A hardcore funk track, it was catchy enough, but felt like it had been built out of spare parts - steal a Bootsy Collins bass line here, borrow a P-Funk sound effect there ... rating: ** stars- Showcasing Brunson's likeable voice, 'In Love with You' was a pedestrian old school ballad. Pretty enough, the track actually would have sound pretty good on top-40 radio. His label seemed to think the same, releasing the track as a promotion 12" single. rating: *** stars- 'Head Games' found Brunson bouncing back to hardcore funk. Sounding like something out of Larry Graham's early catalog, the track was interesting for showcasing Brunson's pop bass skills, but even those were largely buried under the burping synthesizers. rating: *** stars- A collaboration with singer Ethel Beatty, 'Don't Wanna Stop Lovin'' offered up the album's second ballad. Thanks to a nice vocal from Brunson, I actually liked this one better than 'In Love with You'. Unfortunately, the effect was largely trashed by Beatty who sounded like she was a 15 year old version of Minnie Ripperton. rating: ** stars- Offering up a mixture of funk and jazz-rock moves, the instrumental 'Fresh' was probably the album's most interesting number. That probably explains why it was tapped as the lead-off single. For anyone interested, YouTube has a promotion video clip of the track. [...] rating: **** stars- The album's weirdest track, 'Jet City' found Brunson trying out reggae ... nice try, but not a genre that was particularly suited for his skills set. rating: ** stars- A pedestrian, formulaic slice of funk, 'At the Show' was basically DOA. rating: * starThere was certainly talent here, but you had to look long and hard to find it amongst all the wannabe influences.As mentioned, the album was tapped for a couple of singles:- 1984's 'Fresh' b/w 'Fresh (scratch mix)' (Believe In a Dream catalog number 4Z9 04951) # 22 (R&B;)- 1984's 'I'm In Love with You' b/w 'I'm In Love with You' (Believe In a Dream catalog number 4Z9 05007) 12" promo releaseWhile the first single went top-40 on the R&B; charts (Brunson's last chart success), the parent LP vanished without a trace."Fresh" track listing:(side 1)1.) Servo Go-Go (Tyrone Brunson) - 5:382.) In Love with You (Tyrone Brunson - M. Morgan) - 4:293.) Head Games (Tyrone Brunson) - 4:444.) Don't Wanna Stop Lovin' (L. Kirton - B. Eastmond) - 4:45(side 2)1.) Fresh (instrumental) (Tyrone Brunson - M. Bond - B. Eastmond) - 4:202.) Jet City (Tyrone Brunson) - 5:203.) At the Show (Tyrone Brunson - M.

review/summary: This was an intriguing book that influenced my destiny.
review/text: I read &quot;Trouble on Titan&quot; around 1970, when the Apollo program was at its apex, and the human exploration of the Solar System seemed only a short step away. My review is based on old memories, but I can still remember a mining colony on Titan and jet craft using oxygen for fuel and burning Titan's methane atmosphere. We've learned much since this book was written, and Titan's atmosphere has less methane than we originally thought. However, this book was well written, and I am sure will intrigue my son as much as it intrigued his father, who is now working at NASA on the Cassini/Huygens mission to Saturn and Titan. This book has that old-style sci-fi flavor that made another world seem more like reality than fantasy. I think if you enjoyed the Lucky Starr and David Starr stories by Asimov, you will enjoy &quot;Trouble on Titan.&quot;

review/summary: On reflection, what do you think of it now?
review/text: Twelve years after the first review, and Cassini is there. It's Spring on Titan, and it's raining methane. Hydrocarbons are lying about on the surface, in pools larger than the great lakes. Just by dumb luck, the place turns out to be almost exactly how Nourse imagined it. What a piece of work is Man. Especially that one.I read it in 1960, and could see then that it's not really about sports-rockets (although there is a cool one). It's everything a "juvenile" could ever be, with a father-son rapprochement, East-is-East friendships that grow between opposite equals, first love, labor trouble, industrial sabotage, and a rebellion conspiracy. When I first read Heinlein later that year, I thought he suffered by comparison. I was eight at the time.

review/summary: Nice quality, but will not stack well
review/text: My grandson is only 10 months old, so right now, he enjoys shaking and looking at the blocks. What I am disappointed in is the fact that they will not stack very well at all. He tried to put one on the other and it falls right off. They are slippery and not formed so that they can be stacked without falling off each other. Maybe I'm "old school", but I think blocks should be for education with alphabet and even more so, for stacking ability. They are cute, well made, and I will use them as a learning tool for the alphabet with the figures that represent each letter inside the block, but I guess we won't be stacking them!I got a better price buying directly from the fisher price web site catalog. (about $30 with shipping)

review/summary: Love these modern ABC blocks with the little objects inside for extra interest
review/text: I do love these blocks that I bought for my 13 month old grandson for Christmas but later found out that this particular group of peek a blocks doesn't interact with the big cube that my daughter bought for Christmas. It came with its own group of 8 blocks that do interact with the cube but there are other peek a block groups such as the vehicles, jungle animals, farm animals, ABCs. It would have been nice, really rather, e xpected that the ABC blocks especially would have been interactive with the main system and would have announced the name of the letter when that block was affixed onto the activation port, but they don't. I think there may be music played , but that's all. Only the 8 blocks that came with the large cube system are programmed into it.

review/summary: Peek a Fun!
review/text: We got these as a gift for our one year old. He loves them! He tries very hard to get all the little things out of the blocks - and obviously fails. He loves that some of them move, some of them jiggle, some of them make noise - its almost an adventure!The three year old also loves them because they incorporate the alphabet and he can easily identify the items inside: B - Banana, P - Penguin, U - Umbrella, Z - Zebra.Bonus - when the 1 y/o gets frustrated because he can't pry the items out of the block no matter how hard he tries, he usually flings them. The 3 y/o tends to use them to build walls or towers for the sole purpose of smashing another toy into them, or dropping them off high places. And I've stepped on two of them already. They seem to tolerate this treatment rather well.

review/summary: A must have for little ones everywhere!
review/text: My little boy received these as a present on his 1st Birthday. I was a bit worried he would find these boring as he is a very picky boy when it comes to toys.To make this short and sweet, he LOVES these so much!!!I can't imagine not having them now. He adores when I stack them up for him and he knocks them down. He spends a lot of time just shaking them, studying them and handing them to me so I can look at them. He is very proud of his blocks and sometimes throws them on to the wood floor to get my attention. This said, thy are super durable and after much abuse have lived to tell the tale without cracks or coming apart.He also enjoys using these with other toys and will store them in the container type toys.The little objects inside are very cute and some of them move if you turn the little hole on the bottom. (My little one hasn't learned how to do this yet.) The birds make a squeak noise when you push in the bottom and the train is my favorite as it goes round & in a tunnel. A lot of thought were put in these and it shows.An all around wonderful toy!

review/text: Highly recommended. My 16mo daughter has these alphabet blocks plus many of the additional peek-a-block sets. She loves to take each block out of the bin, examine it, and get the next one. This can go on for 20+ minutes, which is hours in toddler land. She has enjoyed playing with them since she was about 9 months old. Each block is so unique and interactive that the set easily captures her interest. We also have the IncrediBlock and other compatible Fisher Price toys. Like any other blocks, they're great for stacking and knocking down. We recently had several parents of similarly aged kids visit our house and they all thought this was a great toy. I love playing with them, too!

review/text: These are clever, cute, colorful, and fun for even mom and dad. He plays with them every day, each one with a different shape, sounds, activity... They were the perfect size for 6-9 mos hands as he learned to grasp, and as he's gotten older, he's more captivated by what's inside or what they do. We just bought more for his first birthday to add to the alphabet set, and I expect that we'll collect additional sets in the next year via auction sites. Just a super buy that I'm glad that we found for our son.

review/text: We got these after seeing the Incrediblocks in the FP Catalog.There are little to no pizazz to the blocks. Some have features where you can "spin" them (like the letter Q - Queen) or the W (watermelon seeds that rattle) - but most are just a "look at me" type of a block.With that in mind - yes I like the product. They're blocks. They're meant for stacking, knocking over and banging - which my son loves (he's had these since he was 6 months). They're better than the plain wooden blocks because they're textured, they have objects inside, letters - lots of opportunities to learn letters, colors, objects, descriptions, etc.For now he's stacking, banging and knocking over. It'll be around for a while until he's ready to learn more words, colors, objects, animals. This review isn't profound or eye openings because again - they're just blocks. Keep that in mind when making your purchasing decision. It will not make your child an overnight rocket scientist =)

My 9 month old enjoys shaking the ones with little pieces inside (like the u for umbrella has little white pellets representing rain). I love all the thought and detail that went into each block. My friend with the older child says she loves them because you can really talk about each block with your child, instead of a regular one dimensional block. Those conversations are huge for language development, teaching colors, aninimals, a whole variety of new words, etc. Buy them! They also make a fantastic unique gift for a friends child. Very well put togethe/durable. I admit, I even enjoy looking at each one to see what the designers came up with.

review/summary: They're thrown, stacked, washed, banged, and not damaged!
review/text: My 15 month old hasn't gotten her hands on these yet (saving for Christmas) but her little friend has a set, and I've been told that they stand up to a LOT of abuse. Our set was sent on time, but I noticed that some of the little toys inside the blocks seem a little dirty. IDK how this could be, since the blocks are sealed so that little ones can't get into the small pieces inside. Guess I'll update this review after my little one gets her hands on these.Update, 8/5/12: My now-16 month old LOVES these little things! She's able to identify the letters through the toys inside them ("find D for ducky!"). She hasn't tried stacking them yet, but they get thrown around and scattered (one survived a throw outside onto asphalt with nary a scratch). I would recommend to anyone with an active toddler! Oh, and they also amuse them during diaper changes -- another plus!

review/summary: Fun selection of blocks! Great alternative to the traditional alphabet blocks
review/text: I love the Peek-a-blocks sets that are out there and I was excited to see the alphabet set available. Every child should have a set of alphabet blocks and these are so much more fun than the basic wood ones. A few people have said that the letter obstructs what is inside, but I don't really agree. While they do have the letter on the one side, you get three other sides to view the inside object just fine. And isn't the point of the alphabet block the letter anyway? It is nice that it comes in a reusable case with a handle too. Just make sure and do your research before you bought. I did some digging around online and got this set for only $25!

review/summary: Great Blocks
review/text: My daughter loves her blocks. She will get them all out and look at each one until she finds her favorite. She likes to shake them and see what each one does. These are cute little blocks that have hours of imaginative playtime inside. They also have blunt corners, so no sharp edges like wood blocks for the safety of smaller children. The fact that they have the letters of the alphabet and a corresponding object inside makes them a great learning tool even for older tots. We have really enjoyed these and recommend them to our friends.

review/summary: Great for kids and parents alike!!!
review/text: When I was in my early teen years, my mom had a set of these for a couple of the kids she babysat. I liked to even then play with these blocks with the kids because they were so interactive and had lots of variety. Now that I'm a dad, I decided that our little 8 month old should have a set to play with. His eyes lit up when seeing them and really loves is when daddy builds them into a tower that he can come an knock down. I'm sure that they are going to be used for years and years to come.They are super durable. The plastic is hard and the pieces are fit together so well that I doubt that they will every come apart without a significant amount of effort by an adult. They are a bit pricey but I feel that they are worth the investment as they will be toys I expect my grandkids to be able to play with someday.

review/text: I bought these blocks for my daughter as a birthday gift and when I received them in the mail there were two "V" blocks and the "T" block was missing. These blocks are so cool, but you might want to make sure the alphabet is correct before wrapping it up as a gift for a child. However, they are the neatest blocks I've ever seen, so it was definitely worth sending them back for a different one.

review/summary: Better than I expected
review/text: I purchased Peek-A-Blocks for both my 1-year old niece and my 8-month old nephew. The nephew lives across the country, so I can't evaluate his opinion of the product. However, my 1-year old niece just loves these blocks. Her 5-year old sister loves them too. The younger niece can easily grab hold of the blocks, and she loves the bright colors. The older niece loves to stack them.The blocks are much more interactive than I first thought they would be. Sure, some of the blocks have loose plastic balls within, and some items are mounted on bouncy springs. However, it's not obvious from the packaging that many other blocks have rotating bases, which allow items within to move around. For example, one block has a train that rotates in and out of a mountain tunnel. There are other nice touches. For example, tapping the fish block causes the fish within to appear as though they are swimming.Lastly, I want to point out an initial hesitation I had about buying these blocks -- a hesitation which turned out to be of no real concern. Years ago, I bought a set of 6 peek-a-blocks for a friend's son. At that time, the blocks were sold in themed sets of 6 blocks (sports, machines, etc). More recently, Fisher Price did away with the smaller sets, replacing them with one large set of 26 blocks, each with a printed alphabet letter on one side. (C = car, D = duck, H = horse, etc.) Anyway, I initially hesitated buying the newer set of Alphabet Peek-A-Blocks, because I thought the alphabet letters would obstruct a child's ability to see the content of the block. However, as I have already mentioned, many blocks allow the contents to be rotated, such that the printed letter no longer blocks a child's view of the content within.In concluding, I am very pleased with the purchase. The kids are too.

review/summary: More fun than you might expect.
review/text: My husband and I bought these blocks as extras for the Incrediblock we'd purchased for our then nine-month-old son. While my son wasn't (and still isn't) wowed by the Incrediblock (you can see my review on that page), he does enjoy playing with the Alphabet Blocks.I like the fact that each block has a big capital letter, and inside, something that starts with that letter; for example, the "D" block has a dog. We'll be able to use these blocks for a long time because of that; I can imagine spending time with my son and teaching him that "C" is for cat -- and he'll be able to see both to make that association.My son, on the other hand, couldn't care less at this point about the letters of the alphabet (he'll soon be one year old), but he does enjoy stacking and knocking over the blocks, banging them together, and especially shaking the ones that make noise. One of his favorites is the "I" block, which has an ice cream sundae inside with lots of sprinkles that rattle merrily when he shakes it.All in all, this is a good, affordable, durable, educational and fun set of blocks. My family continues to be very pleased with them.

review/summary: Great to add to your collection, but not the best Peek-a-Blocks
review/text: I really love all the Fisher Price Peek a Blocks---I saw them long before I knew we'd have a surprise #3 baby and I would actually have an excuse to buy them! Now we own pretty much all the sets. I would have to say this set, although big, is one of the weaker ones. The letters on the sides sometimes block seeing what's inside too well, and the toys inside are not as interactive or interesting as is the case with some of these blocks---for example, a horse that just sits there, a zylophone that doesn't move much, an apple that turns. I like their blocks with tiny things to shake inside or the like---the kind of things babies can't generally play with as they are too small, but that are made safe by being enclosed! Also, having ABCs is most just a way to have a set here I think---unless you are very into early learning, I don't think most babies are really ready to associate the letters with the toys inside (I know SOME babies are, but not that many, and not mine!) However, all this said, I still would say to buy this set, if you know you like this kind of block---It's great to add 26 more in one fell swoop!

review/summary: Pretty good deal but could be more exciting
review/text: I bought these blocks for my daughter when she was 9 months old and she really only enjoys them now. She is 14 months now and is starting to recognize some of the objects inside when I ask her to get them. But be warned bc they're not great for the real younger babies since there are only a few of them that really do anything like beep or rattle. Most of them just have a stationary object that may jiggle a bit. The ones that you can twist yourself are not child-friendly. She can't turn the knob at all so she gets frustrated. My 3 yr old can just do it. He likes them too bc they incorporate the alphabet. Another thing is that the printed letters block some of the objects so it's harder to see inside. I would more so recommend a diff set for a younger baby (6 mos)- like the sound sensations and these for an older child (1 yr). Although you can't beat the price for 26 of these blocks! I also just recently got the Roll-A-Rounds by fisher price as a gift. It's the same concept but a ball vs block. She likes them ALOT!

review/summary: Never Too Old
review/text: After "eyeing" this toy for several months and being hesitant to buy it because of the cost, we finally broke bown and purchased it when our daughter was 15 months old. We're very glad we did!Our daughter loves shaking the blocks, banging them together and knocking over the blocks after we stack them up for her. She really likes putting them all into a plastic bin and then taking them all out again! The letter written on each block is meaningless to her right now, but that time will come.We plan to keep these blocks for a few years. As our daughter approaches school age, the blocks will be a great tool to help teach and reinforce letter-sound association. We believe she may never be too old to benefit from her Peek-A-Boo blocks. We know we're not!Consider donating your set to a local library or school when you're done with them.

review/text: This is a great set of blocks. I researched different blocks for some time and found these to be the most durable, age and developmentally-appropriate, and highly-educational. $25 bucks may seem like a lot, but I think it is well worth it. I am very impressed with the quality.The size and shape of the blocks is just right. My son is 5-months old and he is able to hold the blocks perfectly in his little hands. PLUS, the blocks do not have sharp corners (like the wooden blocks also available on this site) that could hurt your little one (especially those of you with chewers!).One category that I rated this toy with only a 4 (instead of 5) is the "fun" factor. For younger babies that may not "get it" yet, this toy may not be as fun for them until they are a little bit older. My son is not yet able to fully comprehend that there are even toys inside the blocks, but then again he is only 5 months. Give him a couple of months and he'll really dig them!

review/summary: What a great idea!
review/text: This is my first experience with peek-a-boo blocks. I bought this set for my nephew for his 1st birthday and he's absolutely nuts about them. He does all the obvious baby stuff like grasping and chewing and scattering them but he also closely examines what is inside - I can almost see the neurons firing in his little brain. Of course the letters are meaningless right now and yes they might somewhat obstruct the view to the little thing inside but so what? He eventually learns different levels of focus; layers of education.Pricey? Well, that depends. My 3-year old niece loves the blocks just as much and they have deeper meaning for her because she knows all the letters to the alphabet and that the little thing inside the block starts with the letter that's printed on it. Like I said, layers of education. Well worth $25 in my opinion.Oh how I wish I would have known about this type of product when my kids were babies. My son would have loved them. The only reason I rated it as a 4-star as opposed to a 5 is that I am unaware of the availability of other peek-a-boo products. I cannot rate it as "best" when I have nothing to compare it to. Highly recommended

review/text: Bought these for my baby along with the Incrediblock. The blocks are adorable, but when you put them on the Incrediblock, it doesn't make individual letter sounds for them, which is what I expected for the price.It turns out that only the 13 blocks that come with the Incrediblock make any kind of individual noises. These just play random music, which is fine, but I really bought this for the purposes of it being a really educational toy, which it really isn't at this point.The description really should explicitly tell you this.

review/summary: Orca Wisdom as told by Mary Getten
review/text: Whales in the dreams of children, whale spirituality, whale sex and whale governance are all things we'll not likely get from scientific researchers for decades, perhaps a century or two. That is one reason the new book by Mary Getten, a Naturalist specializing in the wildlife of the San Juan Islands and a practicing animal communicator is so brilliant. This is not for folks who think that actual communication with whales (or other critters) is impossible. Those folks are probably the same people who get angry at their dogs for not doing what they are told.Mary herself was once a skeptic, as she relates in "Communicating with Orcas: The Whales' Perspective". At her first animal communication workshop, facilitated by Penelope Smith, Mary was given the task to communicate with Pirouette, Penelope's cockatiel:"I knew nothing about birds. Mammals were my passion, and I had nointerest in delicate little avians. Truthfully, I was a little frightened of them, yet here I was face to face with a cockatiel and it was time for us to talk.I looked into her bright white face, admiring the crest of yellow feathers on her forehead and the orange dot on her cheek. Drinking in her features, I relaxed and thought, this won't be too tough. She seems nice enough. So I began to think about what to say to her.This is where it all went downhill. I didn't have a clue what to say to a bird. You would have though that I'd spent my entire life locked into a closet. Not a single question appeared. Time ticked by and I knew I had to so something, so I kept repeating: "Hello Pirouette. Hello Pirouette. Hello Pirouette."Finally, I stopped for a moment to think of something else to say, and clear as a bell I heard Pirouette say: "Can't you say anything but hello?"Humor, backed with good science and historical tidbits going back to Aristotle and Pliny The Elder balance the presentation for those who are a little reticent to believe in this mode of communication. (This skepticism persists even in the wake of breakthrough research by famed scientist Rupert Sheldrake.) Mary's writing is clear and accessible and the stories of whale sex are quite funny. I mean laugh-out-loud, drool on the PAGE funny.Yet, the skepticism that Mary had when first learning to communicate with animals is the book's biggest weakness, in my view. I was fascinated by the notion of Ruffles, the male elder of the Southern Puget Sound resident community's J Pod, visiting the dreams of schoolchildren who had been on whale-watching cruises. The notion that our species, the lowly Homo sapiens, is at the beginning of a new wave of consciousness that will see remarkable innovations in bodies and senses, or that of the whale councils, the ability to live in past lives (though whales don't call them that) and their description of the universal life force as "The Prime Cause," are all subjects that fascinate me, but the book only teases with these concepts. Perhaps a sequel is called for.However, these are pretty far-out concepts for the average reader and when it comes down to it, Mary has covered the basics in a thorough manner with a wicked wit. If you have the least bit of interest in Orcas, you will be able to read this book in a weekend.May we all be able to live in the moment like these whales have for thousands of years. Their intelligence is much needed in these days when our allegedly more intelligent species, can't get beyond such insanity as war and environmental degradation.Paul Nelson

review/summary: Open your mind and your heart!
review/text: This book is one of the most profound and wonderful books I have ever had the pleasure of reading! It's a beautiful true story that tells of two animal communicators, Mary and her good friend Raphaela, and their conversations with Granny. Granny is a 92 (est.) year-old orca who lives in the Pacific Northwest with her family, J Pod. During Mary and Raphaela's time conversing with Granny, they question her on many aspects of orca life from finding food to orca spirituality. Granny relays a very important message to the human race in this book. A message that MUST NOT be overlooked! This book should be read and emabraced by all. Granny's words certainly opened my eyes and made me see things in a different light. Open your mind and your heart. Read this book!

review/summary: Communication at its Best!!
review/text: When I first picked up the book, Communicating with Orcas by Mary Getten, I was mildly interested in learning about Orca whales. After reading the first few pages I found that I could not put this book down until I had finished reading it. This book is awesome, entertaining, witty, and written from a totally unique whale's perspective which can not help but captivate you. Communicating with Orcas is skillfully presented to communicate points that Granny wishes to make about the life of whales, her profound observations of the human race, and the essential roll that the whales play in raising the consciousness of the earth. Before reading this book, I would never have entertained the idea that communication with a whale or any other animal for that matter could indeed be possible. One has to be able to accept that things do exist that are not readily proven or explained by Newtonian scientific theories. The insight provided in this book will truly astound you. Many past cultures had a closeness to nature that has been lost in today's world. This book takes a refreshing step back into what was and is still possible if we are open to believing

review/text: This is well worth the read if only to gain information about the pods of Orcas that are resident around the San Juan Islands. But well beyond that, whether or not one accepts the author's ability to communicate with the orcas, what she relates about the wisdom of whales (primarily Granny, the 90+year old leader of J pod) is a wake-up call for humanity.

review/text: Whale naturalist and animal communicator Mary Getten goes beyond what other research has achieved in the way of whale study and communication processes: in 1991 she studied the J-Pod, a family of whales off Washington State. Her contention that they use direct telepathic communication between themselves and can do so with humans also makes for fascinating reading.Diane C. DonovanCalifornia Bookwatch

review/text: I found this book amazing. I'm from Michigan and we "Michiganders" tend to think about lakes not oceans. This book opened my eyes to a new way of thinking about the world. It also made me start to think about the oceans creatures in more than just a "far away" way. If you do believe in animal communiation you will find this book to be a wonderfully different type of perspective. If you think animal communication is a "bunch of nonsense" this book may seem really strange to you, but it also makes you start to think "What if the whales do think, What if other animals think, what would they think of us and our running, running rather than enjoying and loving life" I highly recommend this book to all!!

review/text: I LOVED Mary Getten's book "Communicating with Orcas". I couldn't put it down. Reading it, my sense of life's inter-connectedness was profoundly deepened. After I read this book I looked at all life with new eyes and a new heart.I was touched by Getten's love and respect for the Orcas and her courage to share this information with the world. I mean, where else are you going to learn about, among other things, whale sex from their perspective!!!? Her conversations with Granny made me laugh at times, cry at others. They changed me.I have given this book as a gift to several friends and find myself lending out my copy frequently. Reading this book fosters a new reverence for life. Sharing this book with others is one way I work to bring healing to the earth.

review/summary: Great Piece of Scientific Journalism
review/text: i guess there are still come people out there who feel that telepathic communication with animals is impossible. They must not live with pets! I live with 3 dogs and i KNOW we communicate. One thing that is great about this book is that Mary Getten is a scientist, and brings that objectivity to her studies of the orcas. She enlists another communicator, Raphaela Pope, so that they can confirm each other's information. I found this book to be a very well-rounded piece of scientific journalism, they interviewed their subjects on many different topics to present an in-depth view of life from a whales's perpective. I haven't spent much time with whales but this book was a great introduction, probably the best!!

This book is informative, funny, insightful and filled with the kind of respect all the sentient beings deserve. Her book is a glimpse of how well Mary "listens"not only to the cetaceans but all her animal clients. It's heartfelt and honest.Mary's encounters had me steeped in the experience.. It was as if I was right there.I could feel the whales on every page and it made me cry.If you love whales this will take you straight into their world!!! What a great ride!!Thank God people are finally waking up to the truth about communicating with animals..It's about time.. they have so much to teach us.. certainly we can't be that arrogant!!!

review/summary: Not Convinced...
review/text: I got this book about 3 years ago, and I was really excited, because I got it for Christmas. Little did I realise I was actually getting a narative about a woman who says she can telepathically communicate with animals.Now, don't get me wrong. I have done research into the telepathic Animal Communication, even as a freshman in college right now I have done more research into it. And even though there seems to be something, I have yet to see a bonified scientific study followed by a scientific peer reviewed paper on these experiences people have. And even as a person going into a minor Psychology I know that Psychological and behavioral studies are very difficult, becuase of the amazing amount of variables that are caused by the extremely complex brain, alone. But even I can not take much of this at face value.I believe her, I don't think she is lying. I question the validity of the actual communication. Is she really linking mentally to this orca, or is this her not fully understanding the duality that many people fall into, and is she thinking that is J2 (or Granny we call her) talking to her?I really want to give her credit and I really wanted to believe her, but I can't. She didn't give me much to really grab onto as a convincing argument for her so called abilities. And she is not the first animal communicator I have done a little research on. There was one woman mentioned in "Freeing Keiko" who said that whales and dolphins were essentially extraterrestrial beings that were guiding the earth through space. Another woman said that Greyhound dogs were also extraterrestrial beings.Just the simple fact that there is glaring inconstancies between different animal communicators should be enough evidence that there really isn't too much, if anything, to Telepathic Animal Communication.It was an entertianing book, I rather enjoyed it. But I am a sceptic. And being a sceptic I would be completely honest about my position. If something really seems to make sense, I will say it does. But this book didn't. And saying that, I would not be talking about this book to my friends or family. If it does turn up in conversation, it will most likely be during our psuedopyschological studies. That is unless someone can show me a real study that is so sound as to prove me wrong. To which, if it did prove me wrong I would say so.

I have just placed an order for my second Cory Everson's Total Body Workout as I am fearful that my first one will wear out. If inside exercise generally bores you to tears, Cory alleviates the problem.This is a fast paced workout with enough variety to keep you entertained. She includes a warm-up and cool down, trouble zone toning,strength training,step training and circuit training, everything a woman needs to maintain a healthy body in just one hour. It does require a step, for step aerobics, and hand held weights, but there are no gimics, no annoying music or irritating voices just a thoroughly enjoyable workout.

review/text: This was the second of Cory's tapes that I have purchased and was equally if not more so, disappointed. Not having the opportunity to view it, I purchased it based on customer ratings from Amazon. If music and environment is important to you, this is not the right video. The music is not aligned at all with the movement, and either is her counting. Though there are five sections for a full body workout, the exercises are jerky and inefficient. There is no pre-instruction or notice prior to each exercise in addition to little to no safety in the movements or shifting from one to another. Though Cory's reputation with regard to her bodybuilding is well noted, I will not be purchasing any other tapes from her collection. It is the first &quot;instructor of tapes I have noted, wearing evening gown length earrings in her workouts and she and the members of her training look more like first timers for the Playboy collection than serious and directed workout members. Their &quot;bums&quot; are bare for the workouts. All these factors combined, I find them more &quot;show&quot; than anything else.

But that in fact, they are merely stating unpopular views, and are in fact simply being honest.Unfortunately, the truth is that these folks are totally dishonest. And, in some cases, they are unpatriotic as well. On top of that, some of them unequivocally support right-wing Islamic fanaticism. What they frequently appear to want is not academic freedom but the right to engage in academic dishonesty, often in a misguided attempt to hurt a few Jews.We start with a spectacularly dishonest article by Beshara Doumani. He moans that "pro-Israel lobbying groups" and others are "policing what can be said about Israel on campus and in public discourse." Obviously, anyone who has been on a few major American campuses can see that the anti-Israeli folks have been far more effective at doing just this. He says that Lawrence Summers "effectively equated criticism of Israel's policies with anti-Semitism." That's a lie. He then defends the infamous anti-Israeli professors at Columbia University, who in real life substitute racist propaganda for scholarship in the classroom. And he dismisses criticism of this attack on academic standards as the work of right-wing groups, pro-Israeli groups, and donors. Even if some criticism of all this dishonesty were from such groups, that would not invalidate it! He tells us to speak and act before it is too late. I suggest we all do just that, and speak out against him.There are a couple of interesting discussions about the extent to which a professor's "extracurricular" work should be protected. My feeling is that it should be. Noam Chomsky is used as an example. I happen to think that Chomsky ought to have a right to tell outright lies as part of his extracurricular activities as long as he does not commit any felonies. Others feel differently about this, and still others feel that even outright academic dishonesty in one's professional work ought to be okay (something I disagree with completely).By the way, speaking of felonies, we do see a reference that Sami al-Arian was "disciplined for a statement concerning terrorism." But no mention is made of the enormous amount of evidence that al-Arian had long been a terrorist leader. In fact, that evidence finally got al-Arian fired. Are we now supposed to excuse felons, dismissing their crimes under the mantle of academic freedom? I hope not.Judith Butler repeats the slander that "any criticism of Israel" is called anti-Semitic by quite a few folks. And she complains about criticism of the notorious International Solidarity Movement. If she wants to make a case for something, I think she ought to be far more honest. Kathleen Frydl attacks the idea of withholding funding from universities if their expenditures promote "violence, terrorism, or the destruction of any state." Now, maybe the wording of such an idea needs some work. But I think it is completely proper to try to stop universities from spending taxpayer money on pro-terrorist propaganda.Amy Newhall is worried about the United States attaching strings to some language programs. But I think she's the problem here. There are programs that the United States government supports to teach, for example, Arabic in universities. The government does so in the hopes that at least a few students in such programs will use their knowledge of the language to work for the government. If the university encourages them not to do so and we wind up without any benefit from those programs, I think there is no reason to continue them: let the universities use their own money to teach Arabic in that case.Perhaps the most vicious article is by Joel Beinin. Beinin seems to attack everyone who opposes the substitution of dishonest propaganda for scholarly work, calling such opposition the work of people he dubs "the American Likud." He says "this is not the first time right-wing fanatics have waged a campaign of vilification, guilt by association, guilt by ethnic or religious affiliation, and delegitimization of dissenting opinions." And in this regard, he mentions HUAC and Joe McCarthy. But in fact, it is Beinin himself who is doing all this, in the service of right-wing fanatics no less. A special target of Beinin is a particularly praiseworthy organization, Campus Watch. This organization exposes some of the disinformation and incitement we see on campus, but Beinin claims that what it reports is "false and brazenly bigoted." It is neither. Once again, Beinin appears to accuse others of what he himself is guilty of.This book pretends to be defending academia. In fact, it is defending academic dishonesty. This dishonesty is a threat to ruin the reputations of plenty of academic departments and possibly discredit entire fields of study. I think we should all encourage the academic community to fight against such violations of academic standards.

review/summary: Best clarifier ever
review/text: I've used many products to try and help the water clarity, but only kent marine was capable of successfully clearing the water every time. Caution though, adding it to water will drop the pH. Mix with tank water on the side and check pH before placing it in the tank.

review/summary: calm, and quite pretty, but massive
review/text: Best known as the bearded, kinda imposing guitarist/vocalist/viking in the art-metal institution known as Neurosis, Steve Von Till is always working on other projects as well... Harvestman being his latest musical incarnation (with help from friends, including members of Amber Asylum), devoted to making psychedelic, electronic spacerock with a traditional folk heritage. It's like pagans were picked up at Stonehenge by an alien spaceship and deposited on some far off planet aeons hence to make music on futuristic instruments (that we call electric guitars and synthesizers).Lashing The Rye is mostly instrumental, with just two female vocal visitations and (on one song) the sampled voice of Bert Jansch. Also SVT "narrates" on one track, a la Current 93 or something. The twelve tracks here may have titles like "Scarborough Fair" and "Sheep-Crook and Black Dog" (Harvestman's renderings of those two inspired by versions recorded by John Renbourn and Steeleye Span, respectively) but while many of the tunes here may be traditional, Harvestman's interpretation and instrumentation sure ain't! Though there's some delicate guitar and piano (and searing bagpipe) this isn't all that "acoustic" -- there's also plenty of droning electronic spaciness and heavy waves of distorted electric guitar. It's calm, and quite pretty, but massive. Folk-drone for giants. Imagine Amps For Christ teamed up with Kinski. Parts even hint at the density of SUNNO))) or Boris. Recommended!
